In 1986, he co-authored the seminal paper ""Learning representations by back-propagating errors"", a milestone in the development of the neural networks undergirding AI technology. In 2018, he was awarded the Turing Award in recognition of his research breakthroughs.But he is now among a growing number of tech leaders publicly espousing concern about the possible threat posed by AI if machines were to achieve greater intelligence than humans and take control of the planet.""I wouldn't like to devalue climate change. I wouldn't like to say, 'You shouldn't worry about climate change.' That's a huge risk too,"" Hinton said. ""But I think this might end up being more urgent.""He added: ""With climate change, it's very easy to recommend what you should do: you just stop burning carbon. If you do that, eventually things will be okay. For this it's not at all clear what you should do.""Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI fired the starting pistol on a technological arms race in November, when it made AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT available to the public. It soon became the fastest-growing app in history, reaching 100 million monthly users in two months.In April, Twitter CEO Elon Musk joined thousands in signing an open letter calling for a six-month pause in the development of systems more powerful than OpenAI's recently-launched GPT-4.Signatories included Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque, researchers at Alphabet-owned DeepMind, and fellow AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell.While Hinton shares signatories concern that AI may prove to be an existential threat to mankind, he disagreed with pausing research.“It’s utterly unrealistic,” he said. “I'm in the camp that thinks this is an existential risk, and it’s close enough that we ought to be working very hard right now, and putting a lot of resources into figuring out what we can do about it.”In the European Union, a committee of lawmakers responded to the Musk-backed letter, calling on U.S. President Joe Biden to convene a global summit on the future direction of the technology with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Last week, the committee agreed a landmark set of proposals targeting generative AI, which would force companies like OpenAI to disclose any copyright material used to train their models.Meanwhile, Biden held talks with a number of AI company leaders, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the White House, promising a ""frank and constructive discussion"" on the need for companies to be more transparent about their systems.“The tech leaders have the best understanding of it, and the politicians have to be involved,” said Hinton. “It affects us all, so we all have to think about it.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Geoffrey Hinton is widely known as one of the ""godfathers of AI"" He recently announced he had quit Alphabet after a decade at the firm.

1,Remote work experiment was a mistake and it's over now: OpenAI CEO,2023-05-06,09:33 am,Ananya Goyal,https://www.news18.com/amp/tech/heres-what-openai-ceo-says-about-remote-working-for-tech-7732369.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/6_sat/img_1683345059256_450.jpg,"Sam Altman, the brains behind OpenAI and its popular product ChatGPT says now that the pandemic has come to an end, so has the era of remote work. Altman clearly believes that having people come to the office and working in person can be the catalyst to create new products. He feels that working remotely creates confusion as people are virtually meeting and discussing plans. Altman was speaking at a session hosted by Stripe, where he pointed out that for a company to allow full-remote operations, you need the technology to advance, and he says, that hasn’t happened yet. That’s not all, he feels that the work from home is good in some discipline but mostly an experiment. “I think definitely one of tech industry’s worst mistakes in a long time was that everybody (thought they) could go full remote forever, and startups didn’t need to be together. There was going to be no loss of creativity. I would say that the experiment on that is over, and the technology is not yet good enough that people can be full remote forever, particularly on startups,"" he mentioned during the session this week. Altman and Co. have been busy shaping the future of AI in the industry, and he has got big help from a giant like Microsoft. But in recent weeks, many advocates have shown concerns about the growth of AI and how it could affect humanity. Google saw the ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffery Hinton leave the company, and end his journey with a word of caution on the scope of AI. He claimed that exiting Google helps him talk freely about the perils of AI and warn the world about its dangers without any obstacles from Google. Meanwhile, Altman and his team are busy developing ChatGPT into a major force, which already is miles ahead of the competition. The AI chatbot now supports third-party plugins which use the internet to browse for answers.Twitter Blue Struggles To Retain Subscribers As Users Struggle To Find Value: ReportGoogle Bard Is Now Available For Workspace Users, But There's A Caveat: All DetailsRead all the Latest Tech News hereAbout the Author","Sam Altman, the brains behind OpenAI and its popular product ChatGPT says now that the pandemic has come to an end, so has the era of remote work.

According to police sources to New York Post, multiple 911 calls were made after an unconscious person was found lying on the ground near a building on West 15th Street, opposite the 15-story Art Deco building. The police rushed to the spot and found the man unconscious. He was immediately taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Reports suggest, investigators found handprints on the ledge of a 14th-floor open-air terrace, leading them to believe that the man had jumped from there. However, they have not found any suicide note or video of the incident.
This incident comes just a few months after another Google employee, Jacob Pratt, was found dead in an apparent suicide. Pratt, who was 33 years old, was also a software engineer working at the Manhattan headquarters. He was found hanging in an apartment on West 26th Street and 6th Avenue in Chelsea on February 16th.






Google has not issued any statement regarding the incident as of now. However, the incident has once again brought to light the issue of mental health in the tech industry and the need to address it.Discussing suicides can be triggering for some. However, suicides are preventable. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).

But the sophistication of scams on WhatsApp are evolving. Now, you just don’t have to worry about the nagging promotional messages from brands (who do no have the consent to message you on WhatsApp), there have been regular instances of people getting WhatsApp calls (both audio and video) from random international numbers that as per the ISD codes given are originating from countries like Malaysia, Kenya and Vietnam. Most people are obviously flustered to see calls from these countries, and they are also worried as to how these scammers have got their number. As you might know, WhatsApp works through the VoIP network, so these people can call from any country without facing additional charges. These incidents are not at all isolated and searching through social media will tell you that many people are facing this issue. We have also got calls on WhatsApp with codes +60 (Malaysia), +254 (Kenya) and +84 (Vietnam). While others have reported about calls from +62 (Indonesia) and +223 (Mali) among others. Nobody knows the agenda of these calls and the caller but in most cases when you get a call from a random number, chances are they are trying to scam you into revealing confidential data that can aid their purpose of stealing money from your account or others. Having said that, just because you are getting calls from international numbers, it doesn’t mean the origin of the call is from that country.

The company's results contrast with disappointing figures out of big chipmakers due to a slower-than-expected rebound in China's economic growth.Apple executives on Thursday said gross profit margins for the current quarter would be better than forecast despite an expected dip in revenue as supply-chain issues have improved.Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter ended April 1 fell 2.5% to $94.8 billion, ahead of expectations for a 4.4% decline, according to Refinitiv data. Profit was flat at $1.52 per share, compared with estimates of $1.43 per share.IPhone sales were up 1.5% to $51.3 billion, besting expectations for a 3.3% drop even as consumers and businesses tightened up spending due to rising inflation. Global smartphone shipments fell 13% during the first three months of 2023, according to research firm Canalys, which said Apple gained market share against Android rivals.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said Apple's gross margin will be between 44% and 44.5%, above estimates of 43.7%, according to Refinitiv data. But he also said Apple's revenue will likely decline slightly.

Investors see the company as a defensive play during a time of economic uncertainty.Apple raised its dividend to 24 cents a share, up from 23 cents a share a year ago. The board authorized a $90 billion share repurchase program, same as a year ago.Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the company set a fiscal second-quarter record for iPhone sales, thanks in part to picking up new users in markets such as India, where Cook recently traveled for the opening of that country's first Apple stores.""We were thrilled by our performance in emerging markets,"" Cook said. ""We set records for the iPhone installed base in every geographic segment, and we had very strong 'new to' (sales in) emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, India and Mexico.""Cook also said supply-chain snarls have vanished. ""We had no material shortages at all during the quarter across any of the products.""Not all of Apple's business lines were immune to the electronics slump. Sales of Macs fell sharply while iPad revenue slipped. Sales in China also dropped 2.9%, a slightly larger drop than overall revenue.""Apple still needs China on a near-term basis to drive sales and profits,"" said Tom Forte of D.A. Davidson. ""Long-term, emerging markets are important, especially India from a supply chain and sales standpoint.""Other tech firms have predicted a second-half rebound. Wall Street expects Apple to recover faster and show modest year-over-year revenue growth during its fiscal third quarter ending in June.Investors are still waiting for the company's next major hardware product. Bloomberg has reported the iPhone maker could unveil a mixed-reality headset as soon as next month, when it holds its annual software developer conference.

She told the chief executives they have a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their artificial intelligence products and that the administration is open to advancing new regulations and supporting new legislation on artificial intelligence.In response to a question about whether companies are on the same page on regulations, Altman told reporters after the meeting ""we're surprisingly on the same page on what needs to happen.""The administration also announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA.O), OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems.Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, the Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, which was built entirely with AI imagery.Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deepfakes and misinformation.""We don't see this as a race,"" a senior administration official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the U.S.-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their AI use. The Biden administration has also released an AI Bill of Rights and a risk management framework.Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division also said they would use their legal authorities to fight AI-related harm.Tech giants have vowed many times to combat propaganda around elections, fake news about the COVID-19 vaccines, pornography and child exploitation, and hateful messaging targeting ethnic groups.

They bring deep expertise in the design and development of supercomputing systems to support AI and machine learning at scale in Meta's data centers,"" said Jon Carvill, the Meta spokesperson.The move brings additional muscle to the social media giant's bid to improve how its data centers handle AI work, as it races to cope with demand for AI-oriented infrastructure from teams across the company looking to build new features.Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has become increasingly reliant on AI technology to target advertising, select posts for its apps' feeds and purge banned content from its platforms.On top of that, it is now rushing to join competitors like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google in releasing generative AI products capable of creating human-like writing, art and other content, which investors see as the next big growth area for tech companies.The 10 employees' job descriptions on LinkedIn indicated the team had worked on AI-specific networking technology at Graphcore, which develops computer chips and systems optimized for AI work.Carvill declined to say what they would be working on at Meta.Graphcore closed its Oslo office as part of a broader restructuring announced in October last year, a spokesperson for the startup said, as it struggled to make inroads against U.S.-based firms like Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) which dominate the market for AI chips.Meta already has an in-house unit designing several kinds of chips aimed at speeding up and maximizing efficiency for its AI work, including a network chip that performs a sort of air traffic control function for servers, two sources told Reuters.Efficient networking is especially useful for modern AI systems like those behind chatbot ChatGPT or image-generation tool Dall-E, which are far too large to fit onto a single computing chip and must instead be split up over many chips strung together.A new category of network chip has emerged to help keep data moving smoothly within those computing clusters. Nvidia, AMD and Intel Corp (INTC.O) all make such network chips.In addition to its network chip, Meta is also designing a complex computing chip to both train AI models and perform inference, a process in which the trained models make judgments and generate responses to prompts, although it does not expect that chip to be ready until around 2025.Graphcore, one of the UK's most valuable tech startups, once was seen by investors like Microsoft and venture capital firm Sequoia as a promising potential challenger to Nvidia's commanding lead in the market for AI chip systems.However, it faced a setback in 2020 when Microsoft scrapped an early deal to buy Graphcore's chips for its Azure cloud computing platform, according to a report by UK newspaper The Times. Microsoft instead used Nvidia's GPUs to build the massive infrastructure powering ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which Microsoft also backs.Sequoia has since written down its investment in Graphcore to zero, although it remains on the company's board, according to a source familiar with the relationship. The write-down was first reported by Insider in October.The Graphcore spokesperson confirmed the setbacks, but said the company was ""perfectly positioned"" to take advantage of accelerating commercial adoption of AI.Graphcore was last valued at $2.8 billion after raising $222 million in its most recent investment round in 2020.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) has hired an Oslo-based team that until late last year was building artificial-intelligence networking technology at Graphcore.

An Israeli foodtech company says it has 3D printed the first ever ready-to-cook fish fillet using animal cells cultivated and grown in a laboratory.Lab-grown beef and chicken have drawn attention as a way to sidestep the environmental toll of farming and tackle concerns over animal welfare, but few companies have forayed into seafood.Israel's Steakholder Foods has now partnered with Singapore-based Umami Meats to make fish fillets without the need to stalk dwindling fish populations.Umami Meats extracts cells - for now from grouper - and grows them into muscle and fat. Steakholder Foods then adds them to a 'bio-ink' suited for special 3D printers.

11,Musk's Neuralink filled animal safety board with own staff: Report,2023-05-04,11:19 pm,Mansi Agarwal,https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-brain-chip-startup-animal-testing-panel-is-rife-with-potential-conflicts-2023-05-04/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/4_thu/img_1683220732782_763.jpg,"May 4 (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s brain-implant venture has filled an animal-research oversight board with company insiders who may stand to benefit financially as the firm reaches development goals, according to company documents and interviews with six current and former employees.Such oversight boards are required by federal law for organizations experimenting on certain types of animals. The panels are charged with ensuring proper animal care, high research standards, and the reliability of data that helps regulators decide whether drugs or medical devices are safe for human testing.The membership of the panel at Musk’s company, Neuralink, raises questions about potential violations of conflict-of-interest regulations aimed at protecting research integrity, a dozen animal-research and bioethics experts told Reuters. Neuralink is conducting animal experiments as it seeks regulatory approval for human trials of a brain chip intended to help paralyzed people type with their minds, among other ambitious goals.Nineteen of the board’s 22 members were Neuralink employees as of late 2022, according to a company document reviewed by Reuters. The oversight board’s chair was the Neuralink executive who led the company’s animal-care program, and at least 11 other members were employees directly involved with animal care or research.Details of the panel’s membership and its potential conflicts have not been previously reported. Insight into its makeup comes in the wake of two federal investigations, first reported by Reuters, into potential animal-welfare violations by Neuralink and allegations that it improperly transported dangerous pathogens on implants removed from monkey brains. Reuters reported in December that some employees had grown concerned about the animal experiments being rushed under pressure from Musk to speed development, causing needless suffering and deaths of pigs, sheep and monkeys.It’s possible the board’s membership has changed since late last year. Musk and Neuralink didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story or previous Reuters articles about the investigations into its animal testing.The review boards are known as “institutional animal care and use committees,” or IACUCs. The animal-research and bioethics experts said it’s rare for IACUCs to include employees with such direct financial stakes in the research outcome. Putting employees on such panels poses a particular problem at startups such as Neuralink because they tend to focus on a single breakthrough product and commonly reward employees with volatile company shares.Neuralink staffers typically are compensated with salary and stock-based incentives, according to five current and former employees and Neuralink job advertisements reviewed by Reuters. Two of the staffers said some senior-level employees stand to make millions of dollars if the company secures critical regulatory approvals. Reuters couldn’t determine the compensation terms of the Neuralink IACUC members who are also company employees.Neuralink shareholders could see big gains if the private company’s valuation, currently more than $1 billion, continues to soar. Successful animal trials are critical for the company to gain federal approval for human trials and, ultimately, brain-implant commercialization. Reuters reported in March that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected Neuralink’s first human-trial application, in part because the company had not proven the device’s safety in animal tests.Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, a neuroscientist and physician, has conducted brain-implant research at Duke University for nearly three decades. He said the IACUC members overseeing his animal experiments never had any role in the research, including animal tests of the same type Neuralink is conducting now. The independence of such boards, Nicolelis said, is critical to protecting the integrity of animal research that could impact humans in future clinical trials.“It’s an obvious conflict of interest,” he said of the Neuralink board’s composition.Many companies outsource animal testing and oversight to universities or research institutes with strict rules to prevent such conflicts of interest, the animal-research and bioethics experts said. These institutions generally prohibit people with direct financial interests from serving on IACUCs or voting on animal experiments.Neuralink originally partnered with the University of California, Davis, to help conduct and oversee its animal tests. But the company later ditched the university after a dispute, viewing the school’s processes as too slow and bureaucratic, one current and one former Neuralink staffer said. Neuralink then brought the research and oversight in-house.UC Davis declined to comment on Neuralink’s new oversight board but said in a statement that its conflict-of-interest rules prohibit “interested” parties from voting or “influencing decisions” on such panels.The U.S. National Institutes of Health is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research. On projects it backs, the agency bars any IACUC member deriving income or stock from a research sponsor from reviewing or voting on that sponsor’s animal research, said Dr. Patricia Brown, the director of the NIH’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare.The NIH declined to comment on Neuralink’s board. The agency once reached out to Neuralink to offer funding and guidance under a program intended to boost brain-implant research, Reuters previously reported. Neuralink wasn’t interested in NIH funding because Musk wanted to avoid public oversight and perceived bureaucratic hurdles.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the lead agency enforcing animal-welfare regulations. The animal-research experts interviewed by Reuters, including two former top USDA officials, described the agency’s overall enforcement of conflict-of-interest rules as lax.USDA regulations forbid IACUC members from participating in the “review or approval of an activity in which that member has a conflicting interest.” But that rule doesn’t clearly define a conflict. It does offer, as one example, a situation in which a board member is “personally involved in the activity.”The USDA has interpreted the rule narrowly, the experts and former agency officials said. The agency, they said, rarely flags a conflict unless an IACUC member votes to approve a particular experiment the member is also directly running as a company employee. Beyond that, the USDA allows a range of potential conflicts that would never be permitted in human trials, which are overseen by other federal agencies that have similar conflict-of-interest regulations, the experts said. Conflicts such as the ones on Neuralink’s IACUC also are typically prohibited or avoided in animal trials by universities, research institutes and many companies.In response to an inquiry from Reuters, the USDA said it had found no conflicts of interest on Neuralink’s board when the department inspected its animal-research operations during 10 inspections since 2020. The company has passed all inspections with no citations, according to public records and a person with knowledge of the examinations.The agency declined to answer detailed questions about its legal interpretation or enforcement of conflict-of-interest rules for animal research and oversight.The USDA’s Office of Inspector General, the agency now probing potential animal-welfare violations by Neuralink, is also investigating allegedly slipshod Animal Welfare Act enforcement by the USDA itself, in a joint probe with the U.S. Department of Justice, Reuters has reported.The USDA and Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation. The USDA inspector general didn’t respond to requests for comment.The joint probe is examining the agency’s oversight of Neuralink and of animal welfare more broadly. The investigation follows a long history of USDA OIG reports, including three since 2014, blasting the agency’s animal-welfare enforcement as ineffective. One issue is a stretched staff: The USDA employs 122 inspectors to inspect 11,785 facilities, ranging from zoos and breeders to labs, according to a Congressional Research Service report last July.USDA enforcement of conflict-of-interest rules is rare. In more than 11,000 USDA inspections over the past decade, the agency issued eight citations for conflicts at research labs, none of which resulted in a penalty, according to a review of the records by Delcianna Winders, who oversees the Animal Law and Policy Institute at the Vermont Law and Graduate School. The lack of enforcement, she said, poses a serious risk that conflicted IACUC members will put their own interests before those of the animals.“The USDA is really only inspecting paperwork and not looking under the hood,” she said. The case of Neuralink’s board, she said, illustrates the problem with “the overly narrow interpretation the USDA is giving to ‘conflicting interest.’”ANIMAL WELFARE ‘INCIDENT’Between September 2017 and December 2020, Neuralink partnered with the University of California, Davis, relying on the school’s federally funded primate-research lab and its established IACUC. UC Davis received more than $1.9 million from Neuralink for experiments before the partnership ended, the university said. Neuralink surgeons and other staffers continued to work directly on the experiments, in consultation with the university.A UC Davis spokesperson told Reuters the university’s monitoring of Neuralink’s experiments detected an animal-welfare incident in 2019, prompting the university’s IACUC to mandate changes in Neuralink’s research protocols and training. The spokesperson said the incident didn't involve UC Davis staff but declined to comment further.Amid tensions, Neuralink canceled its partnership with UC Davis in 2020, then built its own animal-testing facilities and created its own IACUC.Neuralink’s IACUC is charged with limiting the number of animals tested to the minimum required for research. Tested animals are typically killed after experiments so researchers can examine them post-mortem.The company has rushed and at times botched experiments, especially after it brought animal experiments fully in-house, according to Neuralink staffers and company records seen by Reuters. The company’s IACUC allowed Neuralink to accelerate animal experiments, in line with Musk’s demands, three sources familiar with the panel’s decisions told Reuters.In 2021 and 2022, the company killed about 250 sheep, pigs and primates, the company records show. In one instance in 2021, the company implanted 25 out of 60 pigs with the wrong-sized devices, Reuters previously reported. Neuralink employees said the error could have been avoided with better preparation.Several animal-research experts called the role of board chair Autumn Sorrells — also the executive heading Neuralink’s animal-care program — a particularly troubling conflict.Sorrells didn’t respond to requests for comment.Several of the 22 IACUC members also report to Sorrells in their Neuralink jobs, separate from the board, according to internal documents and two Neuralink sources with knowledge of the committee’s operations. This dynamic discourages those members from dissenting in board matters, one of the sources said.Neuralink never disclosed other IACUC members’ close connections to Sorrells to USDA inspectors during an inspection in January that was prompted by the December Reuters report and related scrutiny from U.S. Congress members, according to a federal official with knowledge of the agency’s dealings with Neuralink. Inspectors likely would have examined the potential conflicts more closely if those connections were disclosed, the official said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersAward-winning journalist covering corporate governance.

She told the chief executives they have a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their artificial intelligence products and that the administration is open to advancing new regulations and supporting new legislation on artificial intelligence.In response to a question about whether companies are on the same page on regulations, Altman told reporters after the meeting ""we're surprisingly on the same page on what needs to happen.""The administration also announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA.O), OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems.Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, the Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, which was built entirely with AI imagery.Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deepfakes and misinformation.""We don't see this as a race,"" a senior administration official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the U.S.-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their AI use. The Biden administration has also released an AI Bill of Rights and a risk management framework.Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division also said they would use their legal authorities to fight AI-related harm.Tech giants have vowed many times to combat propaganda around elections, fake news about the COVID-19 vaccines, pornography and child exploitation, and hateful messaging targeting ethnic groups. But they have been unsuccessful, research and news events show.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","President Joe Biden met with CEOs of top artificial intelligence companies.

What is BIMI?






For Gmail, the feature was introduced in 2021, following a pilot in the previous year. It acts as another layer of security, and to use it, senders must use strong authentication, and verify their brand logos to display the logo as an 'avatar' in emails.
Further, BIMI helps email security systems filter spoofed, fishing emails from the legitimate ones.Availability
Google began rolling out the checkmarks on Wednesday. The feature itself will take up to three days to be fully visible, and will be available to Workspace customers, G Suite Basic and Business customers, as well those with personal Google accounts.

 Similar to OpenAI's viral chatbot ChatGPT, Inflection's AI chatbot, named Pi, uses generative AI technology to interact with users through dialogues, in which people can ask questions and share feedback.Suleyman, Inflection AI's CEO, said the startup developed the technology in-house and its Pi chatbot was built on prioritizing human-like conversations with a high level of emotional intelligence, including being kind and supportive. 
 ""It's very balanced and even-handed on political issues or sensitive topics, but also sometimes it can be funny and silly and creative,"" Suleyman said.
 The chatbot is suitable for personal day-to-day tasks, but not for generating code or essays, he added.
 Suleyman said the company had also spent time on boundary training to make sure the AI did not violate its behavior policies, including engaging in romantic conversations. 
 ""The goal is to make sure that the AI always knows it's an AI and never tries to imitate a human. So it reminds the human user that it is an AI frequently,"" he said.
 Users can interact with Pi across platforms including its website, app and social media platforms like Instagram. The service is free, and the startup may launch premium subscriptions in the future, Suleyman added.
 Pi uses user data, including conversational content, to train its AI systems, according to its terms of service. The chatbot is not currently connected to the internet.Chatbots powered by generative AI technology has become a crowded field since OpenAI's ChatGPT burst into the scene last November. Using large language models, which mine vast amounts of text to summarize information and generate content, chatbots like Google's Bard and Character.AI enable people to have in-depth conversations for both professional and personal needs.
 Founded in 2022, Inflection was incubated by VC firm Greylock, which led a $225 million investment in the startup.Co-founder Hoffman, a partner at Greylock who is also a Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) board member, resigned from OpenAI's board in March, citing potential conflicts due to his work with AI startups.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersKrystal reports on venture capital and startups for Reuters.

Dr Christiano predicts there is a “50/50 chance of doom” once this moment arrives.“I tend to imagine something like a year’s transition from AI systems that are a pretty big deal, to kind of accelerating change, followed by further acceleration, et cetera,” he told the Bankless podcast.“I think once you have that view then a lot of things may feel like AI problems because they happen very shortly after you build AI.”Former OpenAI researcher Paul Christiano now runs the Alignment Research CenterHe added: “The most likely way we die involves – not AI comes out of the blue and kills everyone – but involves we have deployed a lot of AI everywhere... [And] if for some reason, God forbid, all these AI systems were trying to kill us, they would definitely kill us.”The comments come amid increased concerns surrounding the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in recent months, with the so-called godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton quitting Google to sound the alarm about the dangers of AI.Speaking to The New York Times, he said he regretted the work that he had contributed to the field due to the unpredictable future we now face.“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people – a few people believed that – but most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30-50 years or even longer away. Obviously I no longer think that,” he said.“I don’t think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it.”His stance has been praised by other researchers, with AnthropicAI’s Catherine Olsson saying it may encourage others within the field to speak up.“In college I stopped eating meat, on the spot, when a friend asked why I hadn’t yet. Social checks on our ethics can be so influential,” she tweeted. “I often think about when I would quit Anthropic or leave AI entirely. I encourage others to. I can already tell this move will influence me.”Other prominent figures have also urged AI firms to pause development on advanced systems, most recently through an open letter signed by thousands of experts that urged governments to step in if artificial intelligence development was not paused for at least six months.Among the signatories was Elon Musk, who has frequently spoken about the existential threat posed by AI. The tech billionaire, who co-founded OpenAI, tweeted on Monday: “Even benign dependency on AI/Automation is dangerous to civilization if taken so far that we eventually forget how the machines work.”","Former OpenAI worker Paul Christiano now runs AI research non-profit Alignment Research Center.

In fact, the product that eventually became Bard began development in mid-2021, said Blake Lemoine.
“It was not called Bard then, but they were working on it, and they were trying to figure out whether it would be safe to release it. They were on the verge of releasing something in the fall of 2022…so it would have come out right around the same time as ChatGPT, or right before it,” Lemoine told Futurism.
A former member of Google's artificial intelligence team, he added that the chatbot's initial launch was halted in part due to some of the safety concerns raised by him.
Lemoine continued: “Bard could have come 2 years ago, but the company was making sure it doesn’t make up things too often, making sure it does not have racial or gender biases, or political biases…things like that.”






Google, he said, has ‘far more advanced technology' that it hasn’t released yet.
ChatGPT, meanwhile, was introduced in November 2022.Why did Google fire Lemoine?
Internally, Lemoine had raised alarms regarding LaMDA, Google's powerful large language model (LLM). The company, however, did not agree with his claims. He then went to the press, and the organsiation responded by sacking him.
Lemoine joined Google in February 2015 as a software engineer, his LinkedIn profile shows.

In a statement, which confirmed an earlier Reuters report on the planned IPO, Arm said the size and price range for the offering has not yet been determined.The sources cautioned that the exact timing and size of the IPO are subject to market conditions and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.SoftBank and Arm declined to comment.There are signs that the IPO market is beginning to thaw. Johnson & Johnson Inc (JNJ.N) is preparing to list its consumer health business Kenvue Inc (KVUE.N) in New York next week, hoping to raise about $3.5 billion.SoftBank has been targeting a listing for Arm since its deal to sell the chip designer to Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) for $40 billion collapsed last year because of objections from U.S. and European antitrust regulators.Since then, Arm's business has fared better than the broader chip industry thanks to its focus on data center servers and personal computers that generate higher royalty payments. The company said sales were up 28% in its most recent quarter.Arm's IPO is expected to boost the fortunes of SoftBank, which is battling to turn around its giant Vision Fund, which has been hit by losses due to the declining valuations of many of its holdings in technology startups.Earlier this year, Arm rebuffed a campaign from the British government to list its shares in London and said it would pursue a flotation on a U.S. exchange.Arm's IPO preparations are being led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays (BARC.L) and Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T).Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","SoftBank Group Corp's chip maker Arm Ltd has filed with regulators confidentially for a U.S. stock market listing.

The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, said that it fears that some content – such as educational content about sexuality – could be included in that.If that does happen, and it is asked to include age verification checks, it would refuse to comply. Rebecca MacKinnon, from the Wikimedia Foundation, told that BBC that doing so would “violate our commitment to collect minimal data about readers and contributors”.That in turn could leave the app facing sanctions in the UK, and that it could be blocked in the country if it does not comply.It has already said that the website could lead to major problems with the way the site operates, given the vast amount of new content that is being added all the time and the difficulty in moderating it. It has said the Online Safety Bill would also cause problems by forcing it to moderate articles, rather than the volunteers that currently do so.In the House of Lords this week, heritage minister Lord Parkinson said that the bill would probably not include Wikipedia and that it was focused on “only services which pose the highest risk to children will use age verification technologies”.But Lucy Crompton-Reid, from Wikimedia UK which is affiliated with the foundation, told the BBC that the remarks were reassuring but that it did not want to rely on the goodwill of the government.As such, she said it was “definitely possible that one of the most visited websites in the world - and a vital source of freely accessible knowledge and information for millions of people - won’t be accessible to UK readers (let alone UK-based contributors)”.Ms Crompton-Reid’s concerns echoes comments from messaging apps, which have expressed concerns about other parts of the bill. Platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal have said that the legislation could require them to be able to moderate all messages that are passed through their systems – a requirement that would be technically unfeasible because of security settings that they have committed not to weaken.The government has said that the bill is not intended to weaken that security, and has occasionally suggested that the end-to-end encryption technology that powers those apps will still be allowed. But they have argued that those assurances should be written into the legislation, so that the powers in the law cannot be abused at a later date.As such, Signal, WhatsApp and others have said they will leave the UK before they comply with any requirements to weaken their security features.The announcement came shortly after the Wikimedia Foundation was punished by a Russian court over an article about the war in Ukraine. Wikimedia was fined two million roubles ($24,510) for not deleting what Russia said was “banned content” related to the Russian military, Interfax reported.It said this was the seventh fine imposed on Wikimedia in 2023 for not removing prohibited information. The fines now total 8.4 million roubles.The latest penalty was for not removing an article about a military unit that contained “classified military information” about its location, composition and equipment, including information related to the progress of what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine.Wikimedia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously said information that Russian authorities complained about was well-sourced and in line with Wikipedia standards.Wikipedia is one of the few surviving independent sources of information in Russian since a state crackdown on online content intensified after Moscow invaded Ukraine last year.“We are not blocking Wikipedia yet, there are no such plans for now,” Interfax quoted digital affairs minister Maksut Shadaev as saying last week.Additional reporting by Reuters","Wikimedia Foundation says it will refuse to comply with the Online Safety Bill.

Text over the video reads: “I was trying to film a cute Wes Anderson-style WFH [work from home] and accidentally filmed myself getting laid off??!”It was followed by a title sequence that read: “Getting laid off from my job. What the f***.”Viewers then see Lucas going through her morning routine, from getting out of bed to making a cup of coffee to brushing her teeth.She then boots up her computer to start her work day. However, one clip shows her placing her hand over her mouth in shock as she stares at her screen, with text explaining: “Real time opening the email.”Jen then went on a “mental health walk” with her husband and dog, and the last clip shows her walking with her corgi down a road with the text: “Onward to better things.”In the caption, she wrote: “I debated if I should even post this, but if you got laid off too just know you’re not alone.”It comes as Amazon began laying off employees in its cloud computing and human resources divisions this week, with the company slashing costs to stay on top of a slowdown in growth in its retail business and the economic downturn caused by inflation and wage stagnation.The online retail mammoth announced job cuts earlier this year that were expected to affect 18,000 staffers.In a follow-up video, Jen explained that she was “really surprised” to find out she was one of the many employees whose job was affected by the cuts, as she had been working for Amazon for eight years.“I got promoted twice last year, I had an amazing review just a month ago,” she said. “I know it’s not about my performance or who I am as an employee, but that doesn’t make it suck any less.“Part of me is glad to be out glad to be out of this extremely toxic environment and the other part feels like failure and a disappointment and hates that I have to tell people that I got laid off from my job, but that is life and I am human and this does not make me any less amazing or valuable or smart.“I know I’m gonna land on my feet, I know I’m gonna be fine. But this sucks. Like, this is a top 10 bad feeling.”Commenting on her original video, fans noted that it was “peak Wes Anderson” as the filmmaker often focuses on themes of loss.“This is millennial core right now, Wes Anderson and everyone getting laid off,” one person wrote.Another said: “Honestly it’s so much more Wes Anderson this way.”","Jen Lucas, who runs a TikTok account called Jen and Evee, posted a new clip inspired by the current trend on the social media platform that emulates the Grand Budapest Hotel filmmaker’s signature style.

Apple chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook's back-to-office drive has upset a section of employees in his company. In March, the Cupertino-based giant in an email had told the employees that action will be taken against those not going to office at least three days in a week.




Tim Cook (AFP)








A group of Apple employees calling themselves ‘Apple Together’ have shared a Twitter petition arguing that the staff had shown they could do exceptional work while staying at home, Tech Insider reported.
The website was told that there is a Slack channel advocating remote work with more than 10,000 employees. An employee said there is no confusion how a large percentage of staffers feel and that the iPhone maker has this information for a couple of years. Last year, Cook in a memo to the employees had said the revised framework would enhance the employees' ability to work flexibly while preserving the ‘in-person’ collaboration which was essential to the company's culture. In an open letter signed by more than 1,250 people on the ‘Apple Together’ website, the employees have demanded location-flexible work.






An employee who left Apple as per her LinkedIn profile, claimed the company's return-to-office policy had forced her to leave. The ex-employee told the website she struggled to commute from SW Austin and felt she was more productive at home.
According to a person familiar with the development, the company had promoted the ‘return-to-office’ policy to collaborate and generate ‘creative friction’. But this person termed the policy as ‘nonsense’ for most globally distributed terms, the Tech Insider report added.
The employees said the company's explanation that it operated that way is both ‘silly’ and ‘un-Apple’, which is opposite of innovation. The company had mailed a survey to the employees seeking their views on hybrid work which was supposed to close on April 28.

No one was hurt, and no dead birds or wildlife were found on lands owned or managed by the refuge, the agency said.The rocket itself tumbled out of control and blew up in midair a few minutes into its flight.Environmentalists seized on the report as evidence that a more in-depth study of potential hazards to public safety and wildlife should be conducted before further Starship launches are conducted at Boca Chica.""They contemplated debris from these launches, but not part of the launch pad itself being blown out miles away and scattered across the landscape,"" said Jared Margolis, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. ""What happened is not what they anticipated.""NASA is counting on Starship as a major component for its Artemis program, aimed at returning astronauts to the moon in the next few years as a stepping stone to eventual human exploration of Mars.SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Fish and Wildlife Service findings.The April 20 launch was days after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted SpaceX a license to launch the Starship via its Super Heavy rocket booster. The uncrewed test flight was the first for the combined two-stage vehicle.Despite the outcome, SpaceX hailed the aborted mission as a qualified success. The company said it was satisfied in getting Starship off the ground in its maiden test flight, a valuable source of data for further development of the spacecraft.[1/3] Rocks and other debris fly around remote cameras as SpaceX’s next-generation Starship spacecraft atop the Super Heavy rocket lifts off from the company’s Boca Chica launchpad on an uncrewed test flight before exploding near Brownsville, Texas, U.S. April 20, 2023.  REUTERS/Joe SkipperThe report by the Fish and Wildlife Service, part of the U.S. Interior Department, was the first account from government regulators on the extent of collateral damage from the launch, apart from the aerial explosion of the Starship itself.Elon Musk, the billionaire founder and CEO of SpaceX, said on Friday the California-based company now plans to install a water-cooling system and steel foundation for the next launch of the rocket, the most powerful ever built.The FAA last week said it had opened a ""mishap"" investigation, as required by law, effectively grounding the rocket ship until SpaceX determines a root cause for any failures and takes corrective action.On the ground, the force of roughly 30 rocket engines firing at full power pummeled the launchpad floor at liftoff, carving a crater several feet deep into the ground.A resulting plume of concrete dust drifted as far as 6.5 miles (10.5 km) to the northwest, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Pulverized material fell over tidal flats in the area and on Port Isabel, a town near the state's far southeastern tip, said agency spokesperson Aubry Buzek.An environmental assessment that the agency approved last year for the recently expanded Starbase facility envisions blastoff debris remaining within a 700-acre (approximately one square mile) zone around the launchpad.Concrete chunks and metal shrapnel flung thousands of feet from the launch pad would likely have landed in critical habitat for the piping plover, a shorebird on the endangered species list, Margolis said.Before the FAA granted the license, environmentalists had pressed for a more extensive environmental impact study. Margolis said the launch mishap proved the original environmental analysis was inadequate.Reopening the SpaceX facility to a full-scale environmental review would set back Starship development, complicating NASA's Artemis timeline, as well as the anticipated use of the spacecraft for Pentagon and commercial missions.Musk suggested last week that SpaceX could have planned upgrades to the launch site ready for installation before the next launch attempt in one to two months.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","The blastoff from the SpaceX facility, adjacent to a national wildlife refuge near Boca Chica Beach, also hurled large chunks of concrete and metal thousands of feet away.

Addressing what he has called an uncertain economy, CEO Andy Jassy has aimed to slash spending across Amazon's vast array of divisions. At the same time, Amazon is facing a nascent threat from its cloud rivals Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), which are rolling out high-profile artificial intelligence tools.The cost cuts have run deep. Amazon has aimed to axe 27,000 corporate roles since November; and its headcount has fallen 10% to 1.47 million full and part-time workers, including in warehouses, as of the just-ended quarter.The company likewise is ending entire services, among them its Halo health trackers. It has reorganized its national fulfillment operation so it can locate goods closer to shoppers and deliver them faster and cheaper.These moves contributed to Amazon's $3.17 billion profit in the period ended March 31, compared with a loss of $3.84 billion, a year earlier.But this did little to draw investors. David Klink, an analyst at Huntington National Bank, said the company's cloud slowdown was ""tremendous.""""You're not seeing (that) at either Microsoft or Google,"" said Klink, whose bank owned $129 million in Amazon stock as of Thursday.Amazon has sought new revenue all the while. Olsavsky told reporters that the economy has brightened internationally.""It's good to see inflation going down there,"" he said. ""It's good to see consumer confidence increasing.""In North America, Amazon's largest market, demand held up, he said. But ""you see signs that customers are looking for value"" and ""probably putting off some discretionary purchases.""Ultimately, the online retailer reported better-than-expected sales of $127.36 billion in the first three months of the year, and it forecast revenue between $127 billion and $133 billion in the second quarter.Its economy-wary customers aside, Amazon aimed to project confidence for its cloud longer-term.Jassy said the growing adoption of generative AI, which can create text, imagery and other content from past data, represented a huge opportunity for Amazon's cloud. One reason is its proprietary chips that he said can power much of what businesses wish to do with AI; another is Amazon's own new AI tools.Likewise, Olsavsky told reporters, Amazon had seen no shift in the competitive balance among cloud providers. His comments followed a financial report by Microsoft this week that exceeded analysts' expectations as the Amazon rival drew business through AI. AWS sales growth slowed to 15.8% in the first quarter.Dennis Dick, an equity trader and market structure analyst at Triple D Trading, said shareholders were likely to sell.""AWS growth slowing is a signal for investors to take profits,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersAkash reports on technology companies in the United States, electric vehicle companies, and the space industry.

Responding to fan outrage over his tweet on Sushant Singh Rajput, former Twitter India head Manish Maheshwari clarified the intent of his post was to question the ‘chaos and confusion’ around the actor's Twitter handle, which has a blue tick despite him being no more.




Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his apartment in Mumbai in June 2020.








“The intent of the tweet was to bring out the chaos and confusion surrounding the #BlueTick. I have great respect for @itsSSR. Loved his acting in the #MSDhoni movie,” tweeted Maheshwari on Thursday.




On April 26, the former Twitter India chief had posted the following tweet, also tagging Elon Musk, the world's second-richest person who bought the social networking platform in October last year: “Wondering how @itsSSR verified his phone number @elonmusk? Either you are lying or people have figured out a way to carry their phone in afterlife.”






The post, however, left the late actor's fans fuming. ""Sir, As a fan of @itsSSR, I request you not to drag Sushant in all these. Your concern is with his blue tick or how verified his phone number? FYI, many more people got back their blue tick, who r no more & I hope U know how all users get their number verified while signing in,"" said a user.










""Trying to stay relevant using Sushant’s name! Pathetic,"" said another.




Sushant Singh Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai in June 2020.What was the context of Maheshwari's tweet?
On April 11, Musk issued a 'deadline,' saying that from April 20, the microblogging website will begin removing blue checkmarks for accounts that do not subscribe to Twitter Blue, a paid monthly subscription service ($7.99), which grants blue ticks, also called verification badges, to users. Accordingly, on April 20, these were removed from handles of non-subscribers.






Two days later, however, the badges were reinstated for several users, all of whom said it was done without their knowledge and despite them not paying for it. It was observed that the checkmarks were back for accounts with at least 1 million followers; interestingly, these got reinstated for some deceased persons (including Rajput) as well.



At the time of his untimely demise, Sushant Singh Rajput had 2.4 million Twitter followers.








At the time of his untimely demise, the Bollywood star had 2.4 million followers.
It is not yet known, meanwhile, how the badges were restored without subscription, including for deceased people.

53,Germany may restrict export of chip chemicals to China: Report,2023-04-27,10:30 pm,Aishwarya Awasthi,https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-may-restrict-export-chip-chemicals-china-bloomberg-2023-04-27/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/04_apr/27_thu/img_1682612006362_856.jpg,"April 27 (Reuters) - Germany currently has no plans to ban the export to China of chemicals used to manufacture semiconductors, officials said on Friday, a day after a Bloomberg report suggested such a move could be in the works and Beijing called it destabilising.Chancellor Olaf Scholz's office ""is not currently pursuing any plans for an export ban on chip chemicals to China"", a spokesperson said. The person added that talks with foreign partners were confidential, without elaborating.Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the government was considering restrictions on the chemicals in order to reduce Germany's exposure to the Asian economic superpower.The report suggested the move was in early stages of discussion but officials taking part in the talks were aware that such a step could damage business ties with Beijing.China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning, in response to a question on Friday about the potential German curb, said it was ""not constructive for some countries to impose export controls on China in the name of reducing dependence"".Mao said it would only hurt others and destabilise the global industrial supply chain, urging countries planning curbs to respect the regulations of the market economy, and ""work with China to safeguard the international economic and trade order"".Germany is increasingly wary of China as a strategic rival as well as its largest trading partner, and has considered a series of steps as it reassesses bilateral ties.Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) and BASF (BASFn.DE), two German chemicals majors who could be affected by the export curbs if implemented, declined direct comment.But Merck's chief executive Belen Garijo on Friday told its annual meeting that she hoped ""common sense and citizens' interest"" would prevail, noting that Merck had strong roots in China going back nearly 90 years.The easiest way for Germany to implement export controls would be to put the respective goods and services on its national dual-use list, one of the people in Bloomberg's report said.A second German government spokesperson, representing the economy ministry, told a briefing on Friday they were not aware of any mooted chemicals export ban and said there were no related plans for stricter dual-use regulations.A Germany-based chemical industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such move would not make sense as the majority of the semiconductor chemicals value chains of Merck and BASF did not involve Germany or Europe geographically.In many cases, it would amount to an attempt to stop German companies from moving materials between sites in China. German reliance on Chinese imports into Germany would also be exposed in a retaliatory cycle, the source said.If Germany did press ahead with curbs, it would be following moves by some partner countries.The government in the Netherlands, home to semiconductor equipment makers ASM International (ASMI.AS) and ASML Holding (ASML.AS), last month laid out plans to further restrict exports of semiconductor technology to protect national security, joining the U.S. effort to curb chip exports to China.German Economy Minister Robert Habeck had in March suggested that Berlin could impose export restrictions on China to prevent Germany from losing its technological edge, and Scholz's government is working on a strategy paper on China to be rolled out this year.Germany, and the European Union as a whole, are already pushing efforts to bring more chip production onto home soil by offering subsidies.Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), the world's largest, is in talks to open what would be its first European plant in Germany, while U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) announced last year had picked the German town of Magdeburg as the site for a huge new 17-billion euro chip-making complex.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Germany currently has no plans to ban the export to China of chemicals used to manufacture semiconductors, officials say.

54,AI to help predict summer monsoons 18 months in advance: Govt,2023-04-27,08:12 pm,Mansi Agarwal,https://theprint.in/economy/ai-helps-improve-predictability-of-indian-summer-monsoons/1541912/?amp=&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/04_apr/27_thu/img_1682603362389_376.jpg,"New Delhi [India], April 27 (ANI): A newly devised algorithm powered by artificial intelligence can help increase the predictability of the Indian Summer Monsoons (ISMR), 18 months ahead of the season.The algorithm called predictor discovery algorithm (PDA) made using a single ocean-related variable could facilitate skillful forecast of the ISMR in time for making effective agricultural and other economic plans for the country, according to the ministry of science and technology. Scientists at the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), Guwahati, an autonomous institute of department of science and technology (DST), along with their collaborators have found that the widely used sea surface temperature (SST) is inadequate for calculation of long-lead prediction of ISMR. This, they found was because the potential skill of ISMR estimated by the predictor discovery algorithm (PDA) using SST-based predictors was low at all the lead months.The team consisting of IASST, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and Cotton University, Guwahati, devised a predictor discovery algorithm (PDA) that generates predictor at any lead month by projecting the ocean thermocline depth (D20) over the entire tropical belt between 1871 and 2010 onto the correlation map between ISMR and D20 over the same period.The new algorithm indicates that the potential skill of ISMR is maximum (0.87, highest being 1.0), 18 months before the ISMR season. At any lead month, the predictability of the annual variability of ISMR depends on the degree of regularities in the annual variability of its drivers.With the newly discovered basis of long-lead ISMR predictability in place, Devabrat Sharma (IASST), Santu Das (IASST), Subodh K. Saha (IITM), and B N Goswami (Cotton University) were able to make 18-month lead forecast of ISMR between 1980 to 2011 with an actual skill of 0.65 using a machine learning-based ISMR prediction model.According to the statement of the ministry, the success of the model was based on the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to learn the relationship between ISMR and tropical thermocline patterns from 150 years of simulations by 45 physical climate models and transferring that learning to actual observations between 1871 and 1974.As the potential skill of ISMR at 18-month lead is 0.87, there is still considerable scope in improving the model.

Amid the rising activities of adversaries China and Pakistan in the online domain to target India, the Indian Army has operationalised new specialist units to counter these threats and challenges under its cyber warfare initiatives.




Government sources said that Cyberspace has emerged as an important component of the military domain both in grey zone warfare as well as conventional operations. (File)








The decision was taken during the Army Commanders Conference held in the third week of this month headed by Army Chief Gen Manoj Pande.
""To safeguard the communication networks and increase preparedness levels in this niche domain, Command Cyber Operations and Support Wings (CCOSW) are being raised in Indian Army,"" government sources said here.
They said that Cyberspace has emerged as an important component of the military domain both in grey zone warfare as well as conventional operations.
Highlighting the importance and requirement of such specialist units, the sources said the expansion of cyber warfare capabilities by our adversaries has made the cyber domain more competitive and contested than ever before.
""The Indian Army today is rapidly migrating towards net centricity, which entails an increased reliance on modern communication systems at all levels,"" they said.






Specifying the role of these new units, the sources said: ""These organisations will assist the formations to undertake the mandated cyber security functions to strengthen the cyber security posture of the Indian Army.""
In the last few years, the Army has taken multiple steps to counter the aggression of adversaries in the form of virtual honey trapping and hacking.
The Defence Cyber Agency is working at the tri-services level to deal with these issues.
