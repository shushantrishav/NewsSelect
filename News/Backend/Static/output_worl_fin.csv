""A number of cold chain facilities have been looted, damaged and destroyed, including over a million polio vaccines in South Darfur,"" Hazel De Wet, deputy director of the Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF told Reuters in an email.
The agency was in the middle of a series of polio vaccination campaigns in Sudan following an outbreak at the end of 2022.
Polio, a disease which mainly affects children under 5, can lead to paralysis and death. Africa was declared free of wild polio in 2020 but Malawi, Mozambique and Sudan have reported imported cases since last year.
A World Health Organization database shows there have been 28 attacks on health care facilities in Sudan since the conflict erupted last month, pitting Sudan's army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.






Numerous humanitarian agencies have reported looting during the Sudan crisis including the World Food Programme, which said it lost $13-$14 million worth of supplies.

More than 170 people have died after heavy rains and flooding in eastern DR Congo's South Kivu province, officials said Friday, after torrential downpours killed dozens in neighbouring Rwanda.

South Kivu governor Theo Ngwabije said dozens of people were unaccounted for in the Kalehe region, west of Lake Kivu and near the Rwandan border, where the floods also washed away hundreds of homes.
""We have about 176 people dead,"" he said while visiting the affected area.
""This toll is provisional,"" he said. ""We also have about 100 people missing.""
Archimede Karhebwa, the assistant administrator of Kalehe, had earlier told AFP that about 100 people had died, according to a provisional toll.
Several villages in Kalehe were submerged when rivers burst their banks after heavy rains, he said.
Karhebwa said the floods carried away hundreds of houses and also ""surprised vendors and their clients in the markets"".






Innocent Mupenda, a civil society figure from the region, said a downpour started on Thursday afternoon, before the ""river carried away villagers"".
His mother and 11 children died in the flood, Mupenda said.
Vital Muhini, an elected official from Kalehe, also told a local radio station that the floods had been ""devastating human and material damage"". He put the number of deaths at around 150.
AFP was unable to independently confirm the death toll, with reported figures varying.
A member of a rescue team deployed on Friday afternoon, who declined to be named, said ""the search is continuing in the rubble"".
Eastern Congo's deadly flooding follows the death of at least 127 people this week after downpours in neighbouring Rwanda, which lies on the other side of Lake Kivu.‘Sending out an SOS’






Karhebwa, Kalehe's assistant administrator, said that the rivers have burst their banks and caused disastrous flooding on four previous occasions.
The area had been studied and people living by the river requested to leave, he explained.
Deforestation in the area and climate change have contributed to the flooding problem, according to Karhebwa.
""We are sending out an SOS to people of good will and for urgent humanitarian aid,"" he said.
Heavy downpours during rainy seasons in central Africa regularly lead to flooding and landslides.
But experts say extreme weather events in Africa are happening with increased frequency and intensity due to climate change.

Last month, a landslide provoked by torrential downpours killed around 20 people in North Kivu, a province that neighbours South Kivu.

Protesters wore yellow t-shirts to stand out and held up signs saying ""Not My King"".They spent most of the service booing or singing songs such as ""he is just a normal man"".But London police had warned they would take action if protesters tried to ""obstruct the enjoyment and celebration"" of the day, and they formed a ring around the group.Republic said its leader Graham Smith had been detained on Saturday morning and a photo posted on Twitter showed him sitting on the ground surrounded by police officers.""It is disgusting and massively over the top,"" said Kevin John, 57, a salesman from Devon who was among the protesters.""It is also hugely counterproductive by the police because all it has done is create a massive amount of publicity for us. It is completely crazy.""Police did not confirm Smith's arrest but said they had arrested four people on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and three people on suspicion of possessing articles to cause criminal damage in what they called a ""significant police operation"".Republic said hundreds of its placards had been seized.Protests also took place in Glasgow in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales, with signs held up saying: ""Abolish the monarchy, feed the people."" On social media, many contrasted the cost of living crisis in Britain with the pomp and pageantry on display at the coronation.Although the protesters were in a minority compared with the tens of thousands gathered on London’s streets to support the king, polls suggest support for the monarchy is declining and is weakest among young people.With the crown passing from Queen Elizabeth to her less popular son, republican activists hope Charles will be the last British monarch to be crowned.[1/7] Protesters hold placards as people gather on the day of Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation ceremony, in London, Britain May 6, 2023.

They say that the royal family has no place in a modern constitutional democracy and is staggeringly expensive to maintain.Most of the anti-monarchy protesters on Saturday had congregated in Trafalgar Square next to the bronze statue of King Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649, leading to a short-lived republic.Some held up signs saying ""privatise them"" and ""abolish the monarchy, not the right to protest"".Other signs featured a picture of Meghan, the wife of Charles' son Prince Harry, with the words ""the people's princess"", and ""God Save the King"" with a picture of the late soccer great Pele.Since Charles became king last September, there have been protests at royal events. He was heckled at a Commonwealth Day event at Westminster Abbey in March and targeted with eggs in York in November.The death of the queen has also reignited debate in other parts of the world, such as Australia and Jamaica, about the need to retain Charles as their head of state.The state government of New South Wales said it had decided not to light up the sails of the Sydney Opera House to mark the coronation, in order to save money.While many other European monarchies have come and gone, or are far diminished in scale and importance, the British royal family has remained remarkably resilient.In Britain, polls show the majority of the population still want the royal family, but there is a long-term trend of declining support.A poll by YouGov last month found 64% of people in Britain said they had little or no interest in the coronation. Among those aged 18 to 24, the number voicing little or no interest rose to 75%.More than 11,000 police officers are on patrol for the coronation, the biggest ceremonial event staged in the British capital for 70 years.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Police arrest the leader of the anti-monarchy group Republic hours before King Charles' coronation.

8,Trump may reinstate 'Muslim Ban' if re-elected in 2024: Report,2023-05-06,12:24 pm,Bhawana Chaudhary,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-2024-re-election-bid-includes-plans-to-reinstate-infamous-muslim-ban-add-more-countries-to-the-list-reports-101683339288559-amp.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/6_sat/img_1683354841106_279.jpg,"
Former President Donald Trump has privately told close associates that he plans to reinstate his infamous ""Muslim ban"" if he is reelected in 2024, according to US daily Rolling Stone. Trump has reportedly called the policy ""beautiful"" and has expressed interest in adding more majority-Muslim countries to the list of those banned from entering the United States.

Banning Muslims from entering the United States has been a long-standing obsession for Trump, dating back to his presidential campaign in 2015 when he called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" Just a few days after taking office in 2017, he signed an executive order banning the entry of citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days. The ban was met with chaos and confusion at U.S. airports and ports of entry, and led to a diplomatic fallout with Iraq.










Federal courts blocked the initial order, but in 2018, the Supreme Court narrowly approved a subsequent revision of the ban. President Joe Biden reversed the executive order in one of his first executive orders after taking office.
While Trump has hinted at his interest in a reinvigorated travel ban in recent speeches, the idea has not received much public scrutiny. Trump has also touted other hardline anti-immigration policies while campaigning for a potential 2024 bid, including fully securing the border and removing illegal aliens.
Former top Trump White House policy aide Stephen Miller, who helped write the executive order for the original Muslim ban, has also been pressing for a renewed ban. ""Bring back the travel ban. Now,"" Miller wrote on Twitter in August. Miller and other MAGA conservatives have focused on Afghanistan, expressing outrage when the United States took in refugees as the country fell to the Taliban in 2021.






Trump's interest in a second term is not just limited to hardline immigration policies, as he has also proposed bringing back firing squads and mass executions, fantasizing about journalists being raped in prison, and bombing Mexico. His appearance at CPAC featured a speech where he declared himself as the people's ""retribution.""

Critics of the ban have argued that it is an incoherent policy mess that ruined countless families' lives, and would only cause more chaos in the already struggling legal immigration system. It remains to be seen if Trump's plans for a renewed ban will gain any traction in his run for president in 2024.

9,What are the rules that Charles has to follow as King?,2023-05-06,12:50 pm,Ankush Verma,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/king-charles-coronation-rules-b2333461.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/6_sat/img_1683356903024_886.jpg,"The coronation of King Charles III will take place tomorrow, and with it comes a whole set of rules he must follow as Britain’s newest monarch.The ceremony on Saturday 6 May at Westminster Abbey will see King Charles crowned alongside his wife, Queen Consort Camilla. The coronation will be a more “slimmed-down” service than year’s past, with some 2,000 guests invited. The limited guest list is a stark departure from the coronation of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, which was attended by 8,000 guests with 129 nations and territories officially represented at the ceremony.In fact, it’s likely there will be many differences between King Charles’ reign and the late Queen’s. The slimmed-down affair is in line with his concerns over the cost-of-living crisis and his long-standing vision of a modern monarchy. Plus, a close friend of King Charles has suggested the new monarch would be horrified by the public pledging allegiance to him, saying the idea was “ill advised” and not something Charles would have wanted.While much has changed in the last 70 years since Queen Elizabeth was crowned, some royal protocol has stayed the same. Here are just some of the rules King Charles must abide by now that he’s king.The King must wait one year before his coronationRoyal tradition states that the coronation of a new monarch must take place after an appropriate time has passed following the death of the former monarch. Queen Elizabeth II acceded to the throne on 6 February 1952 after the death of her father, King George VI, but wasn’t crowned until 2 June 1953.On 11 October 2022, Buckingham Palace confirmed King Charles’ coronation would occur on Saturday 6 May 2023, less than one month before the 70th anniversary of his mother’s coronation.He must maintain political neutralityIt is a well-known rule that the royal family are required to remain politically neutral. However, they are allowed to raise awareness towards certain humanitarian issues, such as mental health issues and climate change.He can’t sign autographs or pose for selfiesMembers of the British royal family are banned from signing autographs to avoid the risk of their signature being forged. King Charles reportedly responds to autograph requests with: “Sorry, they don’t allow me to do that.”However, the then-Prince of Wales did break royal protocol when he signed an autograph for a victim of the devastating flash floods in Cornwall in 2010, scrawling on a piece of paper: “Charles 2010.”While it’s not against royal protocol to take selfies with fans, the late Queen reportedly frowned upon it. Meghan Markle declined to take a selfie in 2017 when she said, according to royal journalist Victoria Murphy: “We’re not allowed to do selfies.”Another royal fan who attended the Queen’s garden party at Buckingham Palace in 2017 said they weren’t allowed to take selfies with the royals because ""they didn’t want people turning their backs to them.""The King must accept all giftsThe royals must accept all gifts that are given to them during public appearances or on official tours. Though, it’s been reported that the Queen had final say on which members of the family get to keep which gift.On the Royal Family’s official site, it states: “The fundamental principle governing the acceptance of gifts by Members of The Royal Family is that no gifts, including hospitality or services, should be accepted which would, or might appear to, place the Member of The Royal Family under any obligation to the donor.”He can’t eat food from strangers (especially shellfish)King Charles is not permitted to accept food or drink from strangers out of fear of getting sick or poisoned. The same goes for shellfish, which royals are instructed to avoid so that a potential food poisoning doesn’t impede their busy schedules.“When dining, the royal family has to be careful with shellfish due to shellfish poisoning due to their work schedules,” former royal butler and etiquette expert Grant Harrold told Express. “Therefore, you will not normally find this on the royal menu.”The King must follow dining etiquetteIt was commonly known that the Queen only spoke to the person on her right during the first course of dinner, then switched her attention to the person on her left for the second course. When Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton sat to the left of Her Majesty during a luncheon, he was told off by the Queen when he tried to speak to her at the start of the meal.“I got invited to a lunch and was sitting next to The Queen,"" he said during an appearance on the Graham Norton Show in 2015. ""I was excited and started to talk to her but she said, pointing to my left, ‘No, you speak that way first and I’ll speak this way and then I’ll come back to you.’”King Charles is not allowed to travel with the Prince of WalesAccording to royal protocol, two direct heirs to the throne must take separate flights while traveling in case something were to happen en route. The same rule will apply to Prince William and his son, Prince George, once the young royal turns 12 years old.He must always pack a black outfit when he travelsIt is protocol that the royals must pack a black outfit while travelling, to ensure they have something appropriate to wear in case they have to attend a last-minute funeral.The monarch doesn’t need a driver’s license to get behind the wheelThe King also enjoys special driving privileges, as he is the only person in the United Kingdom who can drive without a license. This is because driving licenses are issued by “His Majesty’s Government under His Majesty’s authority,” perThe Mirror.","The coronation of King Charles III will take place tomorrow at Westminster Abbey. The ceremony will see him crowned alongside his wife, Queen Consort Camilla. The coronation will be a more ""slimmed-down"" service than year’s past, with some 2,000 guests invited."

Philippine authorities have rescued over a thousand people from several Asian nations who were trafficked into the country, held captive and forced to run online scams, an official said Saturday.

International alarm has grown in recent months over internet scams in the region often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus crypto investments.
Michelle Sabino, a spokeswoman for the Philippine national police force's anti-cybercrime group, said officers raided a cluster of buildings Thursday in Mabalacat city about 90 kilometres north of Manila.
A total of 1,090 people were rescued who had been recruited to run online scams.
Sabino said the victims were forced to target unsuspecting people in the United States, Europe and Canada.
Their passports were confiscated and they were made to work up to 18 hours a day, with salary deductions for interacting with colleagues or taking extended breaks.
""You're like a prisoner without a cell. You're not even allowed to talk to your roommates,"" Sabino told AFP.






""They're not allowed to leave outside the bounds of the gate. After 18 hours of work, they're brought to their dormitory.""
The victims were mostly Chinese nationals, Vietnamese, Filipinos and Indonesians, police said in a separate statement.
Authorities also rescued people from Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Myanmar, Hong Kong and Nepal.
Sabino said the workers were trained to entice strangers into buying cryptocurrency or depositing money into bogus bank accounts after establishing fake romantic relationships.
""They will build up a promise of a good future together. Let's buy a house, buy a car, let's invest money or let's do business together,"" she said.
At least 12 suspected ringleaders of the scheme have been arrested and are set to be charged with human trafficking. They include seven Chinese nationals, four Indonesians and a Malaysian, Sabino said.






Sabino also said the police operation was the result of a plea by the Indonesian ambassador in Manila for help locating distressed nationals.
Last month, Philippine senator Risa Hontiveros warned that ""scam call centres"" were operating in the Philippines and employing foreigners trafficked into the country.

King Charles' wife Queen Consort Camilla will be crowned with an existing crown at the coronation which has undergone a transformation owing to many controversies. Camilla, will wear a modified version of the Queen Mary's Crown during the service, according to Buckingham Palace. The changes to the crown include removal of the replica of the Kohinoor diamond, the original version of which was first set on Queen Mary's Crown in 1911.Read more: King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla: Their 50-year relationship

The diamond passed through the hands many emperors before being presented to Queen Victoria by the deputy chairman of the East India Company in the 1840s. Owing to the controversy surrounding the symbolism of the Kohinoor diamond, Camilla decided to exclude the gem from the crown she wears at the coronation as even though the UK has retained ownership of the diamond over the years, it remains a point of contention. 
According to Buckingham Palace, Camilla's decision to not commission a new crown was made, “in the interests of sustainability and efficiency” and ""the choice to adorn the crown with new jewels is part of a, “longstanding tradition that the insertion of jewels is unique to the occasion, and reflects the Consort’s individual style.”Read more: Royal fan cheekily asks King Charles to spend the night in her tent.

Camilla's crown will instead feature the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, according to Buckingham Palace. The diamonds- known as the ""Lesser stars of Africa""- are part of a group of stones discovered in 1905 in South Africa. They are controversial as the Cullinan diamond was purchased by South Africa's Transvaal government prior to being gifted to King Edward VII as a ""symbolic gesture"".

Jeffrey Epstein's private islands namely Great St. James and Little St. James are set to be turned into a resort destination by a U.S. billionaire. As per a report by npr.org, the islands were a nexus in Epstein's alleged abuse and trafficking of young women and underage girls.




Jeffrey Epstein's private islands(Twitter)








Since Epstein's death in 2019, the two islands were in limbo and now an investment firm led by billionaire Stephen Deckoff has purchased the two islands for $60 million. Interestingly, the buying price is much lesser than $110 million for which the two properties were recently listed.

The two islands are located near St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The islands played a significant role in the legal proceedings against Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Little St. James, in particular, was frequently mentioned in court documents as the location where many young girls alleged to have been transported by private plane and coerced into engaging in sexual activities with Epstein and other men.






The buyer, Deckoff says that he plans to turn the islands into a ""world-class destination"". He has promised to turn the economic fortunes of the region without destroying the natural beauty.
“Mr. Deckoff plans to develop a state-of-the-art, five-star, world-class luxury 25-room resort that will help bolster tourism, create jobs, and spur economic development in the region, while respecting and preserving the important environment of the islands,” according to a press release about the sale.
In December of last year, a settlement worth $105 million was reached, as per which the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands would receive 50% of the earnings from the sale of Little St. James. This money will be used to establish a trust that will provide support services and counseling for the women who suffered from sexual abuse and human trafficking.






Little St. James covers approximately 71.6 acres of land and boasts several facilities such as a private helipad, dock, gas station, advanced water filtration system, two swimming pools, the main residence, four guest villas, three secluded beaches, a fitness center, a traditional Tiki hut, and several other structures, as indicated in its real estate advertisement.

The comments came after Harry released his memoir, Spare, which contained bombshell and electrifying revelations about the Royal Family.
The 45th US President described Harry’s Spare as ""horrible"" and said he was surprised that Harry had been invited to the celebrations taking place on Saturday, May 6, 2023.
“I was actually surprised that Harry was invited to be honest,” he expressed.
The former president went on to criticize Meghan, saying she had been ""very disrespectful"" to the late Queen Elizabeth II, whom he described as ""incredible"" and ""never controversial"" throughout her decades of service.
In a recent interview with GB News, Trump said, ""I think she [Meghan] has been very disrespectful to the Queen,” added “How can you be so disrespectful to the Queen? She was incredible, for decades and decades she never made a mistake. I cannot think of a mistake she made, she was never controversial.""






Trump ushered another page that despite his thoughts on Harry and Meghan, he believed the Coronation would be a ""great day"" and that King Charles and Queen Camilla ""will do a great job"".
This is not the first time the former US president has criticized Harry and Meghan. Last year, he predicted that their marriage would ""end bad"", and called Harry an ""embarrassment"" and a ""whipped man"". He also criticized Harry for not attending Prince Philip's memorial service, calling it a ""terrible thing"".
In Spare, Harry alleged a fight with his brother Prince William, as well as his bonding with his stepmother, Queen Camilla. The memoir sparked controversy within the Royal Family, with some members reportedly upset about the details that were revealed.






Despite all of these controversies, Harry has confirmed that he will attend his father's Coronation, while Meghan will remain in California to celebrate Archie's fourth birthday.

The Coronation will be Harry's first public appearance with Charles, Camilla, William, and Kate since the release of Spare. The Royal Family recently came together to rehearse their roles for the Westminster Abbey service.

In two days, so many ... killed,"" said a village resident named Ivan not far from where the shooting took place.State broadcaster RTS said the suspect had been involved in an altercation in a school yard. He left to fetch an assault rifle and a handgun, opened fire, then continued to shoot at people from a moving car.The man fired at people in two other nearby villages before fleeing, authorities said. Police found him eventually hiding in his grandfather's house, where they also discovered hand grenades, an automatic rifle and ammunition.""The suspect U.B., born in 2002, has been apprehended in the vicinity of the city of Kragujevac, he is suspected of killing eight people and wounding 14 overnight,"" Serbia's Interior Ministry said in a statement.Police also arrested his grandfather and uncle.In a sombre national address, President Aleksandar Vucic called the incident a ""terrorist attack"" and said the gunman had been wearing a T-shirt with neo-Nazi symbols.""There will be justice. These monsters will never see the light of the day,"" he said, referring to the suspects from both this week's shootings.Despite strong gun controls, Serbia and the rest of the Western Balkans are awash with military-grade weapons and ordnance that stayed in private hands after the 1990s wars.Vucic proposed a moratorium on gun permits, in what he called a ""practical disarmament"" of Serbia that would also include more frequent, mandatory medical and psychological checks of gun owners.[1/11] Members of the forensic team inspect the crime scene, in the aftermath of a shooting in Malo Orasje, Serbia, May 5, 2023.

""My daughter is taking sedatives, we could not sleep all night. They grew up together.""Amid national soul-searching, the editor-in-chief of the Vreme weekly, Filip Svarm, said there was clearly a copycat element in the latest shooting and that media coverage too often ended up glamourising killers.However, tougher restrictions could prove counter-productive, he warned. ""I am afraid that now, precisely because of this panicked reaction from the Serbian president, citizens will start to arm themselves illegally.""Serbia's gun culture is especially entrenched in rural areas.""We don't even have an assessment of how many illegal weapons are out there and what kind,"" said Aleksandar Zivotic, a historian at Belgrade University.In the first shooting case, the detained father of the teen suspect denied any responsibility on Friday, the High Public Prosecutor's office said in a statement.The prosecution said the father, identified as Vladimir K., faced up to 12 years in jail on suspicion of training his son by taking him to target practice and failing to secure arms.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersReports on the Western Balkans and Ukraine.

She told the chief executives they have a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their artificial intelligence products and that the administration is open to advancing new regulations and supporting new legislation on artificial intelligence.In response to a question about whether companies are on the same page on regulations, Altman told reporters after the meeting ""we're surprisingly on the same page on what needs to happen.""The administration also announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA.O), OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems.Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, the Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, which was built entirely with AI imagery.Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deepfakes and misinformation.""We don't see this as a race,"" a senior administration official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the U.S.-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their AI use. The Biden administration has also released an AI Bill of Rights and a risk management framework.Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division also said they would use their legal authorities to fight AI-related harm.Tech giants have vowed many times to combat propaganda around elections, fake news about the COVID-19 vaccines, pornography and child exploitation, and hateful messaging targeting ethnic groups.

19,Conservative Party suffers losses in UK PM's 1st electoral test,2023-05-05,04:57 pm,Bhawana Chaudhary,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunaks-conservatives-lose-seats-early-local-election-results-2023-05-05/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/5_fri/img_1683283721694_109.jpg,"LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives suffered steep losses in Friday's local election result, undermining his attempts to revive their fortunes and emboldening the opposition Labour Party before a national vote expected next year.Sunak came to power in October following a year of political scandals, surging inflation and stagnant economic growth. In office he has faced a cost-of-living crisis, mounting concern about healthcare and widespread industrial action.While governing parties often struggle at mid-term elections, the council results in England are the largest, and possibly last, test of voter sentiment before the next national election due by January 2025.With a majority of councils counting their votes, which do not affect the government's majority in parliament, the Conservatives had a net loss of 943 seats by 1802 GMT, while Labour added 486 seats and the Liberal Democrats gained 353.Labour said they were now on track for power at the next general election. A Sky News projection based on the vote share of the early results said Labour could garner 36-38% of the vote at the next national election, making them the biggest party, with the Conservatives at 28-30%.The projection said Labour might fall short of a majority, though that could depend on how it fares in Scotland, where it is competing to take seats from the Scottish National Party and which did not hold local elections.A similar BBC projection said Labour would get 35% at a national election and the Conservatives 26%, and some in Sunak's party voiced their disquiet over the results.Labour won control of Swindon borough council, a town in southwest England where Labour leader Keir Starmer launched his election campaign, and which has always voted for lawmakers for the governing party since 1983.""No spin, no gloss. This is a dreadful set of results,"" said Justin Tomlinson, Conservative lawmaker in parliament for Swindon North. ""The party collectively needs to take this as a wake-up call to refresh and renew.""[1/5] Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak leaves his campaign headquarters after addressing his supporters, in London, Britain, May 5, 2023. REUTERS/Phil NobleThe votes were to elect around 8,000 councillors to local government authorities which have responsibility for the day-to-day provision of services such as bin collections and schools.Sunak's party suffered losses to Labour in seats in the north and southern England, while the Liberal Democrats advanced in wealthier parts of the south.Sunak told reporters the results so far showed that people wanted his ruling party to deliver on their priorities, but that it was still too early in the process of announcing results to draw firm conclusions as counts continue.John Curtice, Britain's best-known pollster, said that if Conservative losses approached 1,000 seats, it would spell deep electoral trouble, and the results were an ""unambiguous"" rebuff to the party as it tries to stay in government at the next parliamentary election.""(Labour) might achieve winning an overall (parliamentary) majority, not because of any great enthusiasm of the electorate for Labour, but rather simply because the Conservatives are doing so badly,"" he told BBC radio.Sunak has tried to restore the Conservatives' credibility since he took over as prime minister and as his party's third leader in the past year following the scandal-ridden premiership of Boris Johnson and the chaotic economic policies that brought down Liz Truss within two months.Sunak's party lost control of dozens of councils in what Johnny Mercer, a member of parliament for Plymouth, said was a ""terrible"" night for the Conservatives.Labour made gains in some areas that backed leaving the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum which the party will need to win over if it wants to achieve a majority in the next parliament.""Make no mistake, we are on course for a Labour majority at the next general election,"" Starmer said on a visit to Medway, one of the councils it picked up.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives suffer steep losses in local election.

Amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a video has surfaced on social media in which a Ukrainian MP, Oleksandr Marikovskyi, can be purportedly seen punching an unidentified Russian representative who snagged the Ukrainian flag from his hands during a conference in Turkey's capital Ankara.




The incident took place on Thursday during the 61st General Assembly of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation in Ankara.(Source: Twitter)








The incident reportedly took place on Thursday during the 61st General Assembly of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (PABSEC) where countries of the Black Sea region gathered to discuss ways to develop multilateral and bilateral ties on the economic, technological, and social fronts, Turkey's state-run news agency Anadolu Agency reported.
The clip, posted by Jason Jay Smart, a special correspondent for the Kyiv Post on Twitter, and a political adviser, posted the video on Twitter, has gained more than 3 million views as of Friday morning.










Marikovskyi also posted the clip on his Facebook account. Newsweek also reported on the incident, citing Marikovskyi's post.
""He really deserved that punch. Delegate from #Russia sparks scuffle at Black Sea Economic Community event in #Ankara, #Turkey, after forcibly taking the flag of #Ukraine from MP Marikovskyi's hands,"" tweeted advocate Ibrahim Zeidan.









During the summit, the video of the unnamed Russian representative can be seen approaching Marikovskyi, who was holding his country's flag. The Russian delegate forcibly took the flag from Marikovskyi's hands, but Marikovskyi retaliated by pushing and punching the representative in the face to reclaim the flag.
The incident highlights the heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which have been exacerbated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The conflict, which began in February of last year, has now spread to major cities such as Kyiv, Kherson, Odesa, and Bakhmut.Russia blames US for masterminding Kremlin drone attack
Moscow on Thursday accused the US of masterminding a drone attack on the Kremlin, a charge denied by Washington, and said Ukrainian sabotage on Russian territory had reached “unprecedented momentum”.






Moscow said Putin was working from the Kremlin the day after the attack, which it said was a Ukrainian attempt to kill him. ""Decisions on such attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Ukraine has denied responsibility, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying ""We do not attack Moscow or Putin.""
The United States has also denied any involvement.

21,Russia's Wagner group to withdraw from Ukraine's Bakhmut over lack of ammunition,2023-05-05,03:47 pm,Ankush Verma,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-mercenary-chief-prigozhin-says-his-forces-will-leave-bakhmut-next-week-2023-05-05/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/5_fri/img_1683277975585_921.jpg,"May 5 (Reuters) - Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of Russia's Wagner Group mercenary force, said in a dramatic announcement on Friday that his forces would pull out of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that they have been trying to capture since last summer.Prigozhin said they would withdraw on May 10 - ending their involvement in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war - because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies. He asked defence chiefs to insert regular army troops in their place.""I declare on behalf of the Wagner fighters, on behalf of the Wagner command, that on May 10, 2023, we are obliged to transfer positions in the settlement of Bakhmut to units of the defence ministry and withdraw the remains of Wagner to logistics camps to lick our wounds,"" Prigozhin said in a statement.""I'm pulling Wagner units out of Bakhmut because in the absence of ammunition they're doomed to perish senselessly.""The Kremlin declined to comment and there was no immediate reaction from the defence ministry, which said the offensive on Bakhmut continued with paratroopers supporting assault units as a Ukrainian official said Russia was bringing Wagner fighters from elsewhere to fight in Bakhmut.Bakhmut, a city of 70,000 people before the start of the war, has taken on huge symbolic importance for both sides because of the sheer intensity and duration of the fighting there.Wagner has been spearheading Russia's attempt to capture it and Prigozhin said his men had taken all but 2.5 square kilometres of the city which he said was 45 square kilometres in total.It was not clear if his latest statement could be taken at face value, as he has frequently posted impulsive comments in the past. Only last week he withdrew one statement he said he had made as a ""joke"".Earlier on Friday he appeared in a video surrounded by dozens of corpses he said were Wagner fighters, and was shown yelling and swearing at Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov with whom he has a long-running feud.""We have a 70% shortage of ammunition. Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the ******* ammunition?"" he shouted into the camera.In another video issued later, he accused Shoigu and Gerasimov of being responsible for ""tens of thousands of Wagner dead and injured"" and said he would hold them to account.Vladimir Pastukhov, a political analyst, said Prigozhin's behaviour looked like an attempt to pin the blame for Russia's setbacks and losses in Ukraine on Shoigu.""He and Shoigu are playing a zero-sum game in which there cannot be two winners,"" Pastukhov wrote on the Telegram messaging service. ""Someone will have to answer for the mountain of corpses. And that moment is approaching.""His announcement comes at a key juncture in the war, with Ukraine expected to launch a long-anticipated counter-offensive imminently.It was the second dramatic development in the space of three days, after Moscow accused Ukraine of sending drones to the Kremlin in the early hours of Wednesday in an attempt to kill President Vladimir Putin. Kyiv denied it, and the United States dismissed Kremlin claims it was behind the incident as ""lies"".Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin speech writer designated ""a foreign agent"" by Russia, said he thought that Putin would have to intervene in the Prigozhin standoff to show he was decisive as such episodes could become destabilising.Prigozhin's written statement - addressed to the head of the General Staff, the defence ministry, and Putin as supreme commander - was accompanied by a video in which Prigozhin appeared in full combat gear in front of dozens of his fighters, an automatic rifle dangling from his shoulder.""If, because of your petty jealousy, you do not want to give the Russian people the victory of taking Bakhmut, that's your problem.""Rob Lee, a U.S. military expert on Russia, said he thought the Russian defence ministry may have decided to ration ammunition ahead of Ukraine's counter-offensive as it had to ensure the entire front was defended while Prigozhin ""only cares about taking Bakhmut.""The stated withdrawal date of May 10 gives defence chiefs just five days to fill the gap a Wagner pullout would create.One Telegram channel regarded as close to the defence ministry said the May 10 withdrawal date had long been decided and that Prigozhin was now using it as ""a nice pretext"" to blame what it called his failures and heavy losses on a lack of ammo.The same channel said the despatch of regular paratroopers and tank units to Bakhmut had ""almost been agreed"" and that it was not a certainty that Wagner's forces would fall back.Reuters could not verify those assertions.Prigozhin's outburst threatens to overshadow national celebrations on May 9, when Russia commemorates victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two and Putin is due to address the nation from Red Square.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of Russia's Wagner Group mercenary force, said his forces would pull out of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

The United States is ""intensely engaged with the Russians"" in seeking the release of jailed Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter Evan Gershkovich, State Secretary Antony Blinken said, according to the statement released by State Department.

Answering a query over the efforts of freeing jailed Evan Gershkovich, Blinken said, ""It's a sombre day, for the reasons that my alter ego cited just a few minutes ago. We know that journalists around the world are increasingly under siege - under siege in a whole variety of ways.
Blinken was speaking at a World Press Freedom Day event held by the Washington Post.
""That's now manifested itself once again very powerfully in Evan's detention and incarceration, in Moscow - profoundly, unjustly - for doing his job. We're intensely engaged with the Russians to seek his freedom, to seek his immediate release - short of that, just to get what Russia's obligated to provide, which is consular access, which they've done once but have yet to repeat,"" he added.






He further stated that US Ambassador Lynne Tracy had a chance to be with Evan about ten days ago; found Gerschkovich ""incredibly strong of mind and spirit"", which is a very powerful thing in this situation, according to the statement.
Blinken claimed that Russia like some other countries is wrongfully detaining people, using them as political pawns, using them as leverage in a practice that is absolutely unacceptable and that we're working both broadly to try to deter but also at the same time to try to secure the release of those who are being unjustly detained.
Answering a question whether State Secretary had a conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, Blinken said, ""I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov shortly after Evan was detained. I haven't spoken to him since. I made clear the imperative of releasing Evan. I made clear the imperative of getting consular access. We did get consular access after that. We have a channel that President Biden and President Putin established, some time ago, to try to work on these cases, so we're engaged.""






""I wish I could say that at this moment there was a clear way forward. We don't have that at this moment, but it's something that we're working on every single day,"" he added.
Earlier, even before Blinken had a chance to reply to those questions, someone from the audience interrupted him and asked about Julian Assange, as per the statement.
""We can't use this day without calling for the freedom of Julian Assange,"" someone from the audience asked.
""The Biden administration must (inaudible) Julian Assange. Stop the extradition request of Julian Assange,"" again someone asked from the audience.
Blinken didn't answer any of these questions, according to the statement.

The UN chief on Wednesday said ""we failed"" to stop war from erupting in Sudan, where persistent fighting between rival generals undermined efforts to firm up a truce.

""The UN was taken by surprise"" by the conflict, because the world body and others were hopeful that negotiations towards a civilian transition would be successful, Antonio Guterres told reporters in Nairobi.
""To the extent that we and many others were not expecting this to happen, we can say we failed to avoid it to happen,"" the secretary general said.
""A country like Sudan, that has suffered so much... cannot afford a struggle for power between two people.""
Deadly urban combat broke out on April 15 between Sudan's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who commands the regular army, and his deputy turned rival Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).






At least 550 people have been killed and 4,926 wounded, according to the latest health ministry figures which are likely to be incomplete.
Since the fall of strongman Omar al-Bashir in 2019, international mediators have sought to bring civilians and the military to the negotiating table.
But in the process, analysts believe, they gave too much credit to Burhan and Daglo, who worked together in a 2021 coup that derailed the post-Bashir democratic transition.
The two generals later fell out in a power struggle.
Sudan expert Ernst Jan Hogendoorn, writing for the Atlantic Council, said international and regional leaders must ""begin to strategically apply pressure"" by freezing bank accounts and blocking business activities of Sudanese leaders and their forces.‘Heartbreaking’






Guterres spoke on the same day his top humanitarian official, Martin Griffiths, was in Sudan, after neighbouring South Sudan announced on Tuesday that the warring sides had agreed ""in principle"" to a seven-day ceasefire from May 4.
Griffiths arrived in the Red Sea city of Port Sudan -- so far untouched by the fighting -- on an urgent mission to find ways to bring relief to the millions of Sudanese unable to escape.
He called for security guarantees ""at the highest level"" to ensure desperately needed aid deliveries to war-ravaged parts of the country.
The aid chief said he had been informed by the UN's World Food Programme that six trucks bringing aid to the country's western Darfur region had been ""looted en route"" Wednesday, ""despite assurances of safety and security"".






Both Griffiths and the UN's Sudan envoy, Volker Perthes, spoke to Burhan and Daglo over the phone about the necessity for aid to reach people, Griffiths tweeted.
Sudan's warring sides have announced multiple truces but none has effectively taken hold, with the latest 72-hour ceasefire due to expire on Wednesday at 2200 GMT.
UN rights commissioner Volker Turk described the situation as ""heartbreaking"" and ""catastrophic."" He pointed to a military airstrike in the vicinity of a hospital and the RSF using civilian buildings as bases.
Multiple hospitals have been struck during the war, and the UN says only 16 percent of Khartoum's hospitals remain fully functional.
Despite the truce efforts, witnesses reported warplanes over north Khartoum and fierce clashes near the state broadcaster's headquarters in the capital's twin city of Omdurman.






""We heard again loud gunfire and anti-aircraft firing at a fighter jet this morning,"" a resident of south Khartoum said.
Saudi Arabia condemned an attack ""by an armed group"" on Tuesday against the premises of its cultural centre in Khartoum, and called for an end to the violence.‘They burned our houses’
Nearly 450,000 civilians have fled their homes, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said, including more than 115,000 who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.
Mahamat Hassan Hamad, one of more than 30,000 Sudanese refugees who crossed to neighbouring Chad on Sudan's western border, said fighters ""killed people and burned our houses.""
Another refugee, Hawa Ahmat, said she had not eaten or drunk anything for five days before reaching Chad after ""soldiers came, they shot at us at home.""






The failure of the warring generals to abide by their commitments in efforts to end nearly three weeks of fighting has drawn mounting international criticism.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi warned on Tuesday that the fighting in neighbouring Sudan was affecting ""the entire region"".
Griffiths also called for the lifting of ""bureaucratic impediments to delivering assistance"", pointing out that even he had had difficulty obtaining visas for his trip.
In addition to the capital Khartoum, violence has engulfed the Darfur region where at least 99 people have been killed in fighting, according to Sudan's doctors union.
Of the more than 330,000 people displaced inside Sudan, most are from West and South Darfur states, IOM said.
Social media video from El Geneina, West Darfur, showed the ash-covered ground at a burned out camp beside buildings which appeared to be charred. It was unclear who had stayed at the camp.






Toby Harward, who was a UN refugee agency official in Darfur, said ""there was very widespread damage done to many of the major cities"" in Darfur, not only El Geneina.
Darfur is still scarred by a war that erupted in 2003 when Bashir unleashed the Janjaweed militia, mainly recruited from Arab pastoralist tribes, against ethnic minority rebels.
The Janjaweed -- whose actions led to war crimes charges against Bashir and others -- later evolved into the RSF.

Russian shelling in the frontline southern region of Kherson killed at least 23 civilians on Wednesday.Air Force Colonel Yuriy Ihnat said Russia's military was using ""kamikaze"" drones, which fly towards their target before blowing up, to weaken Ukrainian air defences.""They know the (drones) will be destroyed, we are currently destroying 80%, that's how they are exhausting our air defence so much, forcing them to expose their positions,"" he said on television.No casualties were reported in the overnight strikes.In Kyiv, the city administration said that missiles, probably ballistic missiles, had also been used in the attack but were shot down along with all the drones over the capital.Ballistic missiles are difficult to shoot down, and their downing could indicate Ukraine used sophisticated Western-supplied air defence systems against them.Kyiv authorities said ""enemy aerial objects"" had been downed over three districts in the capital's centre and that debris had fallen around 10 buildings.""As a result of the falling debris, parked cars ... and the road's surface were partially damaged,"" said Serhiy Popko, head of the city's military administration.In total, air defences shot down 18 of 24 ""kamikaze"" drones in the pre-dawn attack, officials said.

Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has reached Goa for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. Earlier, while en route, Zardari - the first Pak foreign minister in India since Hina Rabbani Khar in 2011 - emphasised Pak's commitment to the SCO and said his visit was an indication of that commitment.

""I am going to India today where I will be the delegation of Pakistan to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM). My presence will show how important SCO is for Pakistan and how seriously it takes its membership. I am looking forward to engaging bilaterally with other foreign ministers,"" he said, adding that he anticipates holding 'constructive discussions with counterparts from friendly countries'.










The SCO meeting of foreign ministers will be held today and tomorrow in Goa.
China's Qin Gang will also participate in the meeting and news agency ANI shared photos of Qin and Zardari being welcomed at the venue.




Zardari earlier said his visit must not be seen in terms of bilateral ties. 






""We are committed to the SCO charter and this visit should not be seen as a bilateral one but in the context of the SCO.""
Zardari's visit will be the first by a Pak foreign minister since Hina Rabbani Khar's 2011 trip. A formal meeting with India's S Jaishankar is not expected.
Meanwhile, Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif also tweeted to express his country's commitment to the SCO. 










""Pakistan's decision to attend SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in India reflects our commitment to the SCO charter and multilateralism.""
""We are committed to playing our part to advance our shared values of peace and stability in the region. We are all for win-win understandings based on connectivity, trade and mutually advantageous cooperation,"" Sharif tweeted.
The 20-year-old Shanghai Cooperation Organisation counts Russia and four central Asian countries - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan as its members - apart from India, China and Pakistan. India assumed chairmanship in September and will host key meets and the summit this year.
Earlier Arindam Bagchi, the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson, also played down expectation of a bilateral meet with Pakistan in Goa. 






""We look forward to a successful meeting. It will not be appropriate to focus on participation by any one particular country,"" he said.
""Regarding the request for bilateral meetings, I think it is premature. Let's see the full participation. Usually, the external affairs minister does try to hold as many bilateral meetings as he can on the margins of such kinds of multilateral meetings.""

""Air defences are working in the Kyiv region,"" the regional military administration said on Telegram. Reuters eyewitnesses in the city said there had been at least one loud blast.
Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported explosions in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia. Yuri Malashko, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram that anti-aircraft defences were at work.

Donald Trump on Wednesday criticised President Joe Biden for not attending the coronation of King Charles III, as the controversial former US leader toured Scotland and Ireland.

Read here: Royal family ‘relieved’: Meghan Markle's friend on her not attending coronation
Trump, who is seeking a rematch in next year's presidential election, branded Biden's decision to skip Saturday's landmark crowning in London as ""disrespectful"".
Biden will represented by his wife First Lady Jill Biden, with UK and US officials noting this is in line with precedent as no president has attended a British sovereign's coronation.
The last such ceremony occurred in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned.
""When you have somebody that's going to be sleeping instead of coming to the coronation as president of the United States, I think it's a bad thing,"" Trump told Britain's GB News.
""It shouldn't happen. It's disrespectful,"" he told Nigel Farage, a populist British politician and longtime Trump ally, in an interview at one of the latter's two golf resorts in Scotland.






Trump, 76, who formally launched his campaign last November to win back the White House for Republicans, claimed Biden was hindered by his physical condition, despite the 80-year-old president visiting the UK and Ireland last month.
""I would have attended. I think it's a very important event. I think that it's hard for him to do it physically... getting over here for him,"" Trump said.
""But certainly he should be here as a representative of our country. I was surprised when I heard that he wasn't coming.""
The coronation of King Charles III will be attended by around 2,000 people, including leaders, heads of state and royals from around the world.

Donald Trump denied raping writer E. Jean Carroll in a deposition video played on Wednesday for a Manhattan federal jury, as the former US president sought to defend himself in a civil trial without testifying in person.




Former US President Donald Trump. (AFP)








Trump, front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, said in the October 2022 deposition that the alleged rape in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York City decades ago didn’t happen.
“It’s the most ridiculous, disgusting story,” Trump said in the video, hunched over a conference table as Carroll’s lawyers presented documents to him. “It’s just made up.”
Trump will not be testifying in person, and his legal team told US District Judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday they will not be calling any witnesses.
The trial is in its sixth day and is expected to extend into next week.
Carroll’s civil lawsuit for battery and defamation alleges Trump raped her in the mid-1990s and then tarred her reputation by claiming in an October 2022 post on his Truth Social platform that the former Elle magazine advice columnist’s case was a “Hoax and a lie.”






Carroll said during three days of testimony and pointed cross-examination that Trump slammed her against the wall in either 1995 or 1996, put his fingers into her vagina and then inserted his penis.
Denying the allegations, Trump accused Carroll of making up the story to drive sales of a 2019 memoir in which she made her claims public.
The trial has also featured testimony from two women who say Trump sexually assaulted them decades ago.
Former People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff told jurors on Wednesday that Trump cornered her at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in 2005 and forcibly kissed her for a “few minutes” until a butler interrupted the alleged assault.
“It really had a profound effect on me,” Stoynoff said through tears, describing the intense shame and self-doubt she said she felt after the encounter.






Another woman, Jessica Leeds, testified on Tuesday that Trump kissed her, groped her and put his hand up her skirt on a flight in 1979.

""We had nothing to do with this,"" said John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, on MSNBC.
""Peskov is just lying there, pure and simple,"" he added.
Russia alleges that Ukraine carried out a ""terrorist attack"" overnight Tuesday into Wednesday with two drones, aiming to kill President Vladimir Putin, a charge which Kyiv has denied.
Peskov, Putin's longtime press secretary, said earlier Wednesday that ""decisions on such attacks are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington.""
""Kyiv only does what it is told to do,"" he added.
The incident at the Kremlin comes amid several other recent explosions and trail derailments on Russian and occupied Ukrainian territory.
Kirby reiterated in his interview to MSNBC on Wednesday that Washington does not support or condone attacks by Ukraine outside its borders.






""We've been clear with them publicly and we've been clear with them privately that we do not encourage nor do we enable them to strike outside Ukraine,"" he said.

Passenger Chrissie Mayr tweeted about the incident, which she says happened at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. On 2 May, American comedian Ms Mayr shared: “Omfg an @AmericanAir employee forced me and @keanuCthompson to change our pants before getting on the flight which actually turned out to be MORE REVEALING.”Alongside the tweet is a picture of the outfits Ms Mayr and Ms Thompson arrived at the airport wearing, alongside a snap of what they were allegedly asked to change into before boarding. It appears that the pair’s original outfits included a maxi skirt and trousers, while they both ended up in shorts instead. After posting: “THIS IS NO WAY TO TREAT A REWARDS MEMBER,” Ms Mayr added more information in a follow-up tweet.“LITERALLY HAD TO CHANGE AT THE GATE WITH NO COVER,” she claimed. American Airlines’ social media account responded to the thread, asking for Ms Mayr to send over further details: “Your comments concern us. Please join us in DMs, we’re here and ready to listen.”“This was really humiliating and I’m very loyal to you guys, I have the credit card and everything,” Ms Mayr replied. Meanwhile, a user who is thought to be the boyfriend of one of the women said: “Hey how about you start ‘digging’ in Vegas at @LASairport and find the misogynistic creep employee that took their pants AND THEN THEIR LUGGAGE so they couldn’t change back on the plane. Start there @AmericanAir.”People were quick to comment underneath the post, with one user writing: “Wait... what??? They made you change from left to right?”“Talked with a former executive of AA who now works at a different airline and she is completely baffled as to why the gate agent made you change,” another commented.“Because he was a creep,” Ms Mayr replied.Ms Mayr’s travelling companion Ms Thompson then alleged: “He had Chrissie in underwear and me butt f**king naked from my waist down at the gate…. How is this okay?” The Independent has contacted American Airlines for comment.It’s not the first time female passengers have been asked to amend their outfits before boarding a flight.In May 2022, a woman claimed that she was told to “cover up” by Alaska Airlines staff when preparing to board a flight.Tiktok user @badbish1078 shared a video on the social media site showing her sitting in a plane cabin, alongside the caption: “Alaska Airlines just told me I had to ‘cover up’ if I wanted to get on the plane.”The video, filmed in selfie mode, shows the passenger dressed in a zebra print top and denim shorts.In January the same year, a former Miss Universe, Olivia Culpo, was allegedly told to cover up by American Airlines staff, or risk being unable to board her flight to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico.The model was wearing a pair of skintight black shorts with a crop top, which showed her midriff, and a long black cardigan.","Passenger Chrissie Mayr tweeted about the incident, which she says happened at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas.

The White House was quick to reject the charge.Ukraine has also denied involvement in the incident in the early hours of Wednesday, when video footage showed two flying objects approaching the Senate Palace inside the Kremlin walls and one exploding with a bright flash.""Attempts to disown this, both in Kyiv and in Washington, are, of course, absolutely ridiculous. We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington,"" said Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov.He said the United States was ""undoubtedly"" behind the incident and added - again without stating evidence - that Washington often selected both the targets for Ukraine to attack, and the means to attack them.""This is also often dictated from across the ocean ... In Washington they must clearly understand that we know this,"" Peskov said.White House national security spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC television the Russian claims were false, and that Washington does not encourage or enable Ukraine to strike outside its borders.Russia has said with increasing frequency that it sees the United States as a direct participant in the war, intent on inflicting a ""strategic defeat"" on Moscow. The United States denies that, saying it is arming Ukraine to defend itself and retake territory that Moscow has seized illegally in more than 14 months of war.However, Peskov's allegation went further than previous Kremlin accusations against Washington.Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time, and security analysts have poured scorn on the idea that the incident was a serious assassination attempt.But Russia has said it reserves the right to retaliate, and hardliners including former president Dmitry Medvedev have said it should now ""physically eliminate"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Peskov declined to say whether Moscow saw Zelenskiy as a legitimate target.He said Russia had an array of options and the response would be carefully considered and balanced. He said an urgent investigation was under way.Putin was in the Kremlin on Thursday and staff were working normally, he said.The incident took place less than a week before Russia's May 9 Victory Day celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two - an important public holiday and an opportunity for Putin to rally Russians behind what he calls Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.Peskov said air defences would be tightened, and this was happening anyway for the military parade on Red Square, the centrepiece of the holiday, just over the Kremlin wall from the site of the alleged attack.He said the parade would go ahead as normal, and include a speech from Putin.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersChief writer on Russia and CIS.

Jesse McFadden, a 39-year-old convicted sex offender, then shot himself, Prentice said in the first major update on the case.The victims’ bodies were found near a creek and in a heavily wooded area.“The evidence is that Jesse McFadden murdered six people and then killed himself. Beyond that, I don’t know what his thought process was,"" Prentice said. “I’m not going to express a theory because I follow the evidence, and I don’t have any evidence about what the motive was.""Family members have questioned how a rapist accused of soliciting nude images from another teen while behind bars was ever allowed to go free.The shooting happened as a series of ominous text messages — sent by McFadden to his young accuser hours before his trial was to begin on felony charges of soliciting and possessing images of child sex abuse — suggested that he blamed the woman for ending his “great life"" and that he was determined not to return to prison.King Charles III Coronation | World Leaders Attends Coronation Of King Charles | UK News | News18King Charles III Coronation | King Charles Crowning Moment | Westminster Abbey | English NewsAccording to screen grabs of the messages, forwarded to KOKI in Tulsa by the now 23-year-old woman McFadden allegedly groomed from prison, he said he was having success at a marketing job and “making great money.""“Now it’s all gone,"" he texted. “I told you I wouldn’t go back.""“This is all on you for continuing this,"" he finished.A solicitation conviction can mean a 10-year sentence; the pornography charge could mean 20 years behind bars.Prentice declined though to speculate on whether that is what led to the shooting.“Everyone wants to understand why,"" he said. “Normal people can’t understand why. People who perpetrate crimes like this are evil and normal folks like us can’t understand why they do it.""Muskogee County District Attorney Larry Edwards said the young woman shared the text messages with him as well. “They are tragic. Let’s just say that. He more or less blames her for what he did and that’s the part I really have the problem with, because she didn’t do anything wrong,"" Edwards told Tulsa-based KOTV.Authorities began a search after McFadden failed to appear at his long-delayed jury trial on Monday in Muskogee County. His body was later discovered along with his wife, her son and daughters, and two other teens who were visiting the family over the weekend.Now family members of the victims are asking why McFadden, sentenced to 20 years in 2003 for first-degree rape in the sexual assault of a 17-year-old, was freed three years early, in part for good behavior, despite facing new charges that he used a contraband cell phone in 2016 to trade nude photos with the woman, then 16. He was released in 2020 after 16 years and nine months, even though the charges could send him back to prison for many years if convicted.“And they rushed him out of prison. How?"" asked Janette Mayo. She said she was told that her daughter, Holly Guess, 35, and her grandchildren, Rylee Elizabeth Allen, 17; Michael James Mayo, 15; and Tiffany Dore Guess, 13, were all shot to death.“Oklahoma failed to protect families. And because of that my children — my daughter and my grandchildren — are all gone,"" Mayo said. “I’ve lost my daughter and my grandchildren and I’m never going to get to see ’em, never going to get to hold them, and it’s killing me.""Justin Webster, who said he allowed his 14-year-old Ivy Webster to join a sleepover at the McFadden home not knowing anything about the man’s past, raised similar concerns about McFadden’s release.“To get to save some other children, to make a change is what I want to do,"" Webster told The AP during a tearful interview Tuesday in Henryetta, expressing a determination to “tell Ivy’s story and our story and get our government officials and everybody to start speaking up loud and keeping those pedophiles in jail.""“There needs to be repercussions and somebody needs to be held accountable. They let a monster out. They did this,"" Webster said.A spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on why McFadden was released despite facing new felony charges.Prosecutors objected to any early release from prison, noting that he tied a 17-year-old’s hands and feet to bedposts, cut her shirt off and raped her at knifepoint. At one point, he threatened to use the knife on her if she “did not shut up,"" the records show.The circumstances have alarmed Republican state Rep. Justin Humphrey, who chairs his chamber’s Criminal Judiciary Committee. He told The AP in a text that he’s working with another lawmaker on legislation that would “stop tragedies of this nature from occurring again.""He said the effort also will involve trying to determine how a person could commit sex crimes in prison and be released on good behavior, and how McFadden was able to be in contact with minors while on sex offender supervision.Court records show McFadden was charged with the new crimes in 2017 after the young woman’s relative alerted authorities. Set free in October 2020, he was arrested the next month and then released on $25,000 bond pending the trial, which was repeatedly delayed, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.McFadden married Holly Guess in May 2022; what she knew of his record isn’t clear. Mayo said the family didn’t learn about her son-in-law’s criminal history until a few months ago.“He lied to my daughter, and he convinced her it was all just a huge mistake,"" said Mayo, of Westville. “He was very standoffish, generally very quiet, but he kept my daughter and the kids basically under lock and key. He had to know where they were at all times, which sent red flags up.""According to Okmulgee County Sheriff Eddy Rice, the seven bodies were found on the property where McFadden lived near Henryetta, a town of about 6,000 about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of Oklahoma City. The dead bodies included the two teens who had been reported as missing and in danger — Webster, 14, and Brittany Brewer, 16.Brittany Brewer’s father confirmed that his daughter was among the dead. At a vigil Monday night, Nathan Brewer said “It’s just a parent’s worst nightmare, and I’m living it.""The grim discovery could push the number of people slain in mass killings past 100 for the year, according to a database maintained by The AP and USA Today in a partnership with Northeastern University.Read all the Latest News here(This story has not been edited by News18 staff and is published from a syndicated news agency feed)About the Author","Jesse McFadden, a 39-year-old convicted sex offender, shot his wife, her three children and their two friends in the head and then killed himself, police said.

Gulsen was then jailed for five days and later spent 15 days under house arrest despite issuing an apology for the incident. The court found her guilty of the charge and initially sentenced her to one year in prison but later reduced the sentence owing to her “respectful stance” during the trial. 
Gulsen was also warned that if she passes such remarks again she could be jailed further within the next five years. Although the singer has rejected the accusations saying that her comment “was a joke between two people.” She had told the court that she had just teased a band member who was nicknamed “Imam” but had not attended a religious school.






Her lawyer also reiterated that the comment was a joke and requested her acquittal saying “there was no crime.”
The pop singer was previously attacked for her stage outfits and for unfurling an LGBTQ flag at a concert.

Hundreds of people marched in their funeral procession through the streets of the city as gunmen fired into the air.Palestinian militant group Hamas said the men killed were members of its armed wing and confirmed they had carried out the April 7 attack in which British-Israeli Lucy Dee, 48, and her daughters Maia, 20, and Rina, 15, were killed, while travelling from their home in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.In a separate incident nearby, at the flashpoint village of Huwara, a Palestinian woman stabbed an Israeli soldier and was then shot by him and a second soldier, the military said.The woman, identified as Iman Odeh, 26, died of her injuries, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.The incidents came after an exchange of cross-border strikes between Israel and Gaza earlier in the week and more than a year of violence that has seen repeated Israeli raids in the West Bank as well as a series of attacks by Palestinians on Israelis.The shooting attack on the Dee family, which British Foreign Minister James Cleverly described as ""abhorrent"", shocked Israelis, who flocked to the Dees' funerals last month.In a radio interview with Israeli public broadcaster Kan, Rabbi Leo Dee, the family's father, thanked the Israeli security forces and said he was more consoled by meeting transplant patients this week who had received his wife's organs.""That was a great comfort,"" Dee said.In Nablus, witnesses said Israeli undercover units surrounded a house in the old city before a gun battle which left the structure badly damaged by explosions and bullet holes.Since the beginning of the year, more than 100 Palestinians, most of them fighters in militant groups but some of them civilians including children, have been killed by Israeli forces and at least 18 Israelis and foreigners have been killed.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem threatened revenge for the killing of the gunmen who were barricaded in the house.

The coronation ceremony for King Charles on Saturday will be the most glorious display of pageantry seen in Britain for a generation and will provide an economic boost to the nation, its organiser and Buckingham Palace have said.

Charles, along with his wife Camilla, will be crowned at London's Westminster Abbey in a historic event whose origins date back some 1,000 years, and involving thousands of military personnel in a mile-long procession through central London.
""This is a proud moment in our national history,"" said Earl Marshal Edward Fitzalan-Howard, the Duke of Norfolk and England's most senior peer.
""This is also a time to remind ourselves of the pride we have in our great country and our unwritten constitution which has served us so well for over 1,000 years during our long history,"" Fitzalan-Howard, whose family have organised state occasions since 1483, told reporters.
Some 7,000 armed forces personnel will be involved in ceremonial duties, with more than 4,000, including military bands, taking part in a procession from the Abbey back to Buckingham Palace where the newly-crowned king and queen will be given a royal salute in the gardens.






It will be ""a glorious display of pageantry"", Fitzalan-Howard said. The royals will, as is traditional, wave to the crowds from the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards, and there will be a flypast by military aircraft.
As the palace has previously acknowledged, the service itself will be different to that of Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago, reflecting the different eras.
There will be only 2,300 guests in Westminster Abbey as opposed to the 8,000 who watched in 1953, although 100 heads of state will still be present, and it will be much shorter.
Critics have questioned the cost of a lavish coronation when the public is facing a cost of living crisis but a palace spokesperson said there were reports that more than 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion) was expected to flow into the struggling economy as a result.






""It’s not for me to say how accurate those figures are but certainly the theory pertains that the celebrations are an enormous economic boost to the nation,"" the spokesperson said, adding that having so many heads of state present was also a huge networking opportunity.
However, consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said it expected that British gross domestic product would fall about 0.2% month-to-month in May, with the decline due to the extra bank holiday the government has allocated for the coronation.

The Israeli military conducted air strikes and traded fire with Gaza militants on Tuesday in a flare-up of violence following the death in Israeli custody of a Palestinian prisoner on hunger strike.




The army said it hit Gaza with ""tank fire"" in response to rockets from the Palestinian enclave








The army said it hit Gaza with ""tank fire"" in response to rockets from the Palestinian enclave, sparking a renewed volley from Gaza witnessed by AFP journalists.
The army late on Tuesday said it was carrying out air strikes on Gaza. The raids targeted several sites, including one belonging to Islamist movement Hamas that controls the territory, according to security sources and Palestinian witnesses.
The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it responded by firing surface-to-air missiles.Also read: As the Arabs and Iran reconcile, what happens to Israel?
The exchange of fire came after 45-year-old prisoner Khader Adnan died, nearly three months after being detained in the occupied West Bank over his ties to the Islamic Jihad militant group.






Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh described his death as a ""deliberate assassination"", charging Israel had killed him ""by rejecting his request for his release, neglecting him medically and keeping him in his cell, despite the seriousness of his health condition"".
News of his death was initially followed by three rockets fired by militants from Gaza, the Israeli army said.
Israel's retaliatory tank fire was met with a further 22 projectiles launched from Gaza, the military reported.
A joint statement by militant factions in Gaza, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, said the rocket fire was an ""initial response"" to Adnan's death.
The Magen David Adom emergency service said three people were wounded with shrapnel in the Sderot area, near the Gaza border.Gaza mortar fire






After meeting with the military chief, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned ""anyone who attempts to harm the citizens of Israel will be sorry.""
Adnan was the first Palestinian to die as a direct result of a hunger strike, according to advocacy group the Palestinian Prisoners' Club.
Other Palestinian detainees have died ""as a result of attempts to force feed them"", said the group's director Qaddura Faris.
Palestinians launched a general strike in West Bank cities in response to Adnan's death.
Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said prison officials decided to close cells to ""prevent riots"".
""The directive to the prisoner service is zero tolerance towards hunger strikes and disturbances in security prisons,"" he said.
In the evening, six mortar shells were fired towards Israel, falling in Gaza and in the area of the security fence, the Israeli army said.'Pay the price'






A senior Israeli official described Adnan as ""a hunger striker who refused medical attention, risking his life"".
""The military appeal court decided against releasing him from detention solely on the merit of his medical condition,"" said the official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly to the media.
Adnan was described by the official as an ""operative"" of Islamic Jihad, who was facing charges related to his activities within the militant group.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War and its forces regularly detain Palestinians, who are subject to Israeli military courts.
Islamic Jihad, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States, warned Israel would ""pay the price for this crime"".






Israel's prison service said Adnan was in jail for the 10th time and his wife, Randa Mousa, previously told AFP her husband had carried out multiple hunger strikes in detention.Family against Gaza rockets
Speaking on Tuesday, Mousa said she was proud of her husband's ""martyrdom"" which the family wears like ""a crown on our heads"".
But she cautioned militants against launching a violent response.
""We don't want a drop of blood to be shed,"" she told journalists in the family's hometown of Arraba in the northern West Bank.
""We don't want anyone to respond to the martyrdom. We don't want someone to launch rockets and then (Israel) strikes Gaza.""
In his final message, Adnan said he was ""sending you these words as my flesh and fat has melted"".Also read: Israel trusts India, comfortable sharing security secrets: Minister Nir Barkat






""I pray that God accepts me as a faithful martyr,"" he wrote, in a message published Monday by the Palestinian Prisoners' Club.
Physicians for Human Rights Israel said its medic visited Adnan and raised his ""life-threatening condition and the need for immediate hospital transfer"".
Israeli rights group BTselem described his hunger strike as ""a form of non-violent protest against his arrest and the injustices of the occupation"".
""The fact that a person whose life was in danger remained in prison despite repeated requests to transfer him to a hospital reflects the absolute disregard Israel held for his life,"" the organisation said.

Mr Milic said the dead pupils were born between 2009 and 2011.Serbia’s interior minister, Bratislav Gasic, suggested the handguns were kept in a safe but that the suspect apparently knew the code. Mr Gasic said the boy’s father was also arrested.In an evening address, the country's President Aleksandar Vucic announced tougher curbs on gun ownership, including a moratorium on new gun licenses other than for hunting, revision of existing permits and surveillance of shooting ranges and how civilians store their weapons.The suspected shooter, who at 13 is below Serbia's age of criminal responsibility, will be placed in a psychiatric institution, Mr Vucic said, adding that both his father and mother had been arrested. ""He was the best student. He had asked for a transfer to another class where he had three friends,"" Mr Vucic said. ""He was waiting for this day. He was at the shooting range with his father three times.""Mass shootings are extremely rare in Serbia and in the wider Balkan region; none have been reported at schools in recent years. In the last mass shooting, a Balkan war veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village in 2013. However, experts have repeatedly warned of the danger posed by the large number of weapons in the country after the wars of the 1990s. In the deadliest shooting in Serbia since then, Ljubisa Bogdanovic killed 14 people in 2013. Other mass shootings occurred in 2007, 2015 and 2016. All the assailants were adults.Milan Milosevic, father of one of the pupils at the school said his daughter was in the classroom with the attacker.“She managed to escape. [The assailant] ... first shot the teacher and then he started shooting randomly,” he told broadcaster N1.Police block streets around the Vladislav Ribnikar schoolMr Milosevic, who said he rushed to the school after hearing of the shooting, said: “I saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts.”An unnamed student who was in a sports class when gunfire erupted elsewhere in the building told the Associated Press: “I was able to hear the shooting. It was nonstop.”“I didn’t know what was happening. We were receiving some messages on the phone,” the student added, describing the shooting suspect as a “quiet guy” who had good grades.Milan Nedeljkovic, the mayor of the district of Vracar where the shooting happened, said that most of the students were taken out of the school through a back door.“We have video surveillance, but now this is a lesson, we need metal detectors too,” he said. “It is a huge tragedy ... something like this in Belgrade. Such a tragedy at an elementary school.”Mr Nedeljkovic said doctors were fighting to save the teacher's life. Sinisa Ducic – the acting director of a paediatric clinic in Belgrade treating three of the children – said one, a girl, was undergoing surgery on her head. “She has a serious injury,” Mr Ducic told reporters.Milika Asanin, head of Belgrade's University Hospital, said it was treating three pupils and the teacher. “The teacher has a stomach injury and injuries to both hands,” he said.Police at the scene following school shootingSerbia’s education minister, Branko Ruzic, declared three days of national mourning over the school shooting, starting on Friday.“It is unthinkable when you see the scene of the place, what the children have been through, and the teachers, the teachers who have tried to protect the children,” he told a press conference.“Sadly there is no possible way for them to come back,” said health minister, Danica Grujicic, close to tears. “This is the worst thing I have seen in my whole career as a doctor and as a human being.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report","Seven girls and one boy confirmed among the dead, with four further boys and two girls and a teacher seriously injured.

Spokesperson for Mumbai dabbawalas Vishnu Kaldoke told ANI: “Mumbai Dabbawalas have had good relations with the British royalty. Two dabbawalas were invited to his wedding. It was an honour for us. He is about to become the King. So, we want to present King Charles with Puneri Pagadi & a shawl of the Warkari community.”










Reportedly in 2003, Charles III had met the dabbawalas at Mumbai's Churchgate station during his visit to the city. Later in 2005, two dabbawalas attended the royal wedding of Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles.
When Queen Elizabeth II passed away in 2022, the Mumbai Dabbawala Association expressed their sorrow. “The Mumbai Dabbawala Association has had a very close relationship with the British Royal Family ever since Prince Charles visited India. We are very sad to hear about the death of Queen Elizabeth II and all Dabbawalas pray that her soul rests in peace,” Chairman of the association Subhash Talekar had said.

No further details were provided.The incident comes after Iran on Thursday seized a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman called the Advantage Sweet. That tanker is being held by Iranian authorities in Bandar Abbas, the Marshall Islands flag registry said on Tuesday.Maritime security firm Ambrey has said it believed the Advantage Sweet's seizure was in response to a recent seizure via a court order by the United States of an oil cargo aboard the Marshall Islands tanker Suez Rajan.The Niovi oil tanker seized on Wednesday had been travelling from Dubai toward the UAE's Fujairah port when it was forced by IRGCN boats to change course towards Iranian territorial waters, the Navy said.The Niovi last reported its position at 0231 GMT on Wednesday off the coast of Oman in the Strait of Hormuz with Fujairah as its destination, Refinitiv ship tracking data showed.According to the International Maritime Organization shipping database,, the Niovi's owner is Grand Financing Co, and the ship is managed by Greece-based Smart Tankers, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Vedant Patel, a deputy spokesperson at the U.S. State Department, told reporters the Biden administration and the ""international community"" call on Iran and its Navy to release the ships and their crews. ""Iran's harassment of vessels and interference with navigational rights in regional and international waters are contrary to international law and disruptive to regional stability and security,"" Patel said.About a fifth of the world's crude oil and oil products passes through the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point between Iran and Oman, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa.""Heightened military activity and geopolitical tensions in these regions continue to pose serious threats to commercial vessels,"" the Marshall Islands flag registry said in an advisory on Tuesday.""Associated with these threats is the potential for miscalculation or misidentification, which could lead to aggressive actions.""Since 2019, there have been a series of attacks on shipping in the strategic Gulf waters at times of tension between the United States and Iran.Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with world powers have stalled since September over a range of issues, including the Islamic Republic's violent crackdown on popular protests, Tehran's sale of drones to Russia and acceleration of its nuclear program.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",The Panama-flagged oil tanker Niovi was seized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy.

57,US Fed hikes key interest rates by 25 bps to 16-year high,2023-05-03,11:36 pm,Pragya Swastik,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-likely-hike-rates-hint-pause-tightening-cycle-2023-05-03/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/3_wed/img_1683123483650_13.jpg,"WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve moved its management of the post-pandemic economic recovery into a new phase on Wednesday with what may be the last in a historic series of interest rate hikes and heightened attention to credit and other economic risks.The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 5.00%-5.25% range, as expected by financial markets, but in doing so dropped from its policy statement language saying that it ""anticipates"" further rate increases would be needed.The change doesn't foreclose the central bank's policy-setting committee from hiking rates again when it meets in June, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was now an open question whether further increases will be warranted in an economy still facing high inflation, but also showing signs of a slowdown and with risks of a tough credit crackdown by banks on the horizon.""We're closer, or maybe even there,"" Powell said of the end-point of rate increases that have boosted the Fed's policy rate by a full 5 percentage points in the 10 meetings since March 2022, a torrid pace for the central bank and one that may now warrant allowing some time for the impact to be felt in full.Using language reminiscent of when it halted its tightening cycle in 2006, the Fed said that ""in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate,"" officials would take into account how the impact of monetary policy was accumulating in the economy.Top of mind: inflation and the impact of a credit tightening Fed officials feel is still evolving in the wake of both higher interest rates and a financial sector rattled by the recent failure of three U.S. banks.At a press conference following the release of the statement, Powell said inflation remains the chief concern, and that it is therefore too soon to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle is over.""We are prepared to do more"" he said, with policy decisions from June onward to be made on a ""meeting-by-meeting"" basis.He also pushed back on market expectations that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would cut rates this year, saying such a move was unlikely.""We on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down not so quickly, it will take some time,"" he told reporters, and ""in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates"" this year.Powell, however, agreed ""policy is tight,"" and said that makes it possible the central bank has done enough with rates, particularly given the developing strains in the economy, the possibility that credit tightening by banks may slow the economy more than expected, and a remaining Fed hope that a recession can be avoided.The Fed's policy rate is now roughly the same as it was on the eve of a destabilizing financial crisis 16 years ago, and is at the level which a majority of Fed officials projected in March would in fact be ""sufficiently restrictive"" to return inflation to the central bank's 2% target. Inflation is currently still more than twice that target.Economic growth remains modest, but ""recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,"" the Fed said in its statement.Yet job gains ""have been robust,"" the Fed said, and Powell noted that some recent data on falling job openings and lower earnings growth, coupled with historically low unemployment, supported the idea that the economy could slow without a dramatic rise in joblessness.""The case of avoiding a recession is in my view more likely than that of having a recession,"" Powell said.Risks around a U.S. debt limit standoff between Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Joe Biden have added to the sense of caution about trying to tighten financial conditions further.The shift in the Fed's approach was reflected in U.S. interest rate futures, which showed broad expectations for no hikes at either of the central bank's next two policy meetings.U.S. stocks initially held onto gains after the release of the Fed statement, but fell later in the afternoon and closed lower. Yields on U.S. Treasury securities dropped sharply, while the dollar weakened against a basket of trading partner currencies.""For me the key was a change of a single word, saying that they believe that they will be determining whether future raises are necessary, whereas last time they said that they are anticipating that further rate hikes will be necessary,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""With the word 'determining' in place of 'anticipating,' (it) is essentially telling the markets that the Fed is now on pause.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersCovers the U.S. Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy, a graduate of the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University with previous experience as a foreign correspondent, economics reporter and on the local staff of the Washington Post.Thomson ReutersReports on the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy.

A woman told a New York civil trial on Tuesday that Donald Trump sexually assaulted her on a flight in the United States in the late 1970s.

Read here: 'Donald Trump raped me', author E Jean Carroll testifies: ‘He thrust…’
Jessica Leeds recounted the alleged attack while testifying in the writer E. Jean Carroll's rape and defamation lawsuit against the ex-president.
Trump denies all allegations of sexual assault and has never been criminally prosecuted over any such claims.
Leeds told Manhattan's federal court that Trump put his hand up her skirt in the business class section of a flight to New York in 1978 or 1979.
""There was no conversation. It was like out of the blue,"" said Leeds, now 81.
""He was trying to kiss me, grabbing my breasts,"" she added.
Leeds first made the allegation in an interview with the New York Times weeks before the 2016 election that sent Trump to the White House.






Some dozen women came forward accusing Trump of sexual misconduct in the run-up to the vote.
Leeds went public with the accusation after Trump refuted sexual assault allegations during a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton.
""I was furious because he was lying,"" Leeds recalled.
Leeds was called to testify by Carroll's lawyers to try to persuade the nine-person jury that Trump has engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct.
Carroll, 79, has sued Trump alleging he sexually assaulted her in a changing room at the luxury Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the mid-1990s.
She also claims that Trump then defamed her when he called her ""a complete con job"" after she went public with the allegation in 2019.






Trump has repeatedly and strenuously denied the allegations.
Carroll filed her lawsuit late last year after a law took effect in New York that gave victims of sexual assault a one-year window to sue their alleged abusers decades after attacks may have occurred.
The suit seeks unspecified damages and asks that Trump retract his comments.
No criminal prosecution can stem from Carroll's civil case but if Trump loses it will be the first time he has ever been held legally liable for an allegation of sexual assault.
The case is one of several legal challenges facing Trump as the 76-year-old Republican seeks a return to the White House in next year's election.
Last month he pleaded not guilty in a criminal case related to a hush-money payment made to a porn star just before the 2016 vote.

Trump is also being investigated over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the southern state of Georgia, his alleged mishandling of classified documents taken from the White House and his involvement in the storming of the US Capitol by his supporters on January 6, 2021.

The last of four former Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd has been found guilty of manslaughter.

Tou Thao, who held back onlookers as three other officers pinned the 46-year-old Black man to the ground, was convicted by Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill after a bench trial in the northern US city.
Thao opted to be tried by a judge rather than by a jury. Cahill convicted him on Monday and the decision was released on Tuesday.
Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, was captured in a video that went viral kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes, until he passed out and died.
Two other officers helped restrain Floyd, who lay handcuffed face down on the ground complaining he was unable to breathe, while Thao kept away the crowd.






""Like the bystanders, Thao could see Floyd's life slowly ebbing away as the restraint continued,"" the judge said.
""Yet Thao made a conscious decision to actively participate in Floyd's death: he held back the concerned bystanders and even prevented an off-duty Minneapolis firefighter from rendering the medical aid Floyd so desperately needed.""
Floyd's May 2020 death sparked protests against racial injustice and police brutality across the United States.
Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of murder in April 2021 and sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.
The other two officers who restrained Floyd, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, pleaded guilty to second degree manslaughter, the same charge leveled against Thao.
Lane was sentenced to 36 months in prison while Kueng received 42 months.






Thao's sentencing was set for August 7.
Chauvin, Lane, Kueng and Thao were also convicted of federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights during his arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison called Thao's conviction the ""historic and the right outcome.""
""It brings one more measure of accountability in the tragic death of George Floyd,"" Ellison said in a statement. ""Accountability is not justice, but it is a step on the road to justice.""

66,Australia to ban recreational vaping in major public health move,2023-05-02,04:56 pm,Bhawana Chaudhary,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-ban-recreational-vaping-e-cigarette-crackdown-2023-05-02/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/2_tue/img_1683022149720_625.jpg,"SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Australia said on Tuesday it will ban recreational vaping and tighten other aspects of e-cigarette laws in the biggest crackdown on the tobacco industry in more than a decade to try to stop an alarming rise in teenage vaping.The government aims to ban all disposable vapes, which often comes in fruity flavours, ban the import of non-prescription vapes and limit nicotine levels, aiming for the sale of vapes to be confined to helping smokers quit.""Just like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts,"" Health Minister Mark Butler said in a speech at the National Press Club.Vaping, widely seen as a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes and useful for helping smokers quit, involves heating a liquid that contains nicotine in what is called an e-cigarette and turning it into a vapour that users inhale.But studies have shown the potential of long-term harm from the addictive e-cigarettes.Under the new rules, vapes will be sold only in pharmacies and require ""pharmaceutical-type"" packaging. Disposable vapes popular with young people will also be banned.Though a prescription is needed to buy nicotine vapes in Australia, lax border enforcement and a thriving illegal market mean they are readily available in convenience stores and other outlets.Major vape manufacturer Philip Morris (PM.N) welcomed the crackdown on such shops.""Nicotine vaping products sold in corner stores have always been illegal,"" a spokesperson for the company said.""We have been urging enforcement against these illegal products for several years and hope this will now happen.""Butler said vaping had become a recreational product in Australia, mostly sold to teenagers and young people, who are three times as likely to take up smoking.""This is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars,"" Butler said. ""Vaping has now become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And it's becoming widespread in primary schools as well.""Doctors backed the vaping crackdown but urged the government to do more to limit the number of young people taking it up.""Nicotine vaping products are being sold featuring colourful flavours and we have even seen products featuring the same type of imagery as children's breakfast cereal including cartoon characters,"" said Nicole Higgins, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.About 22% of Australians aged 18-24 have used an e-cigarette or vaping device at least once, data last year showed.The federal budget, due out next week, will include A$234 million ($155 million) for measures to protect against the harm caused by tobacco and vaping.Australia has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the world.In 2012, it became the first country to force cigarette producers to abandon distinct, colourful branding and sell their products in uniformly drab packets.Tobacco firms were quick to switch to e-cigarettes that offer different flavours and created designs targeting a new generation of users.Butler said the government had no plan to follow neighbouring New Zealand in banning cigarette sales for future generations but said the tax on tobacco would be raised by 5% a year over the next three years in a bid to curb sales.Some countries have tried to restrict vaping and some see it as a good way to get smokers to kick the habit.Britain said in April up to one million smokers would be encouraged to swap cigarettes for vapes, in what was a world first, offering financial incentives for pregnant women and providing e-cigarette starter kits to help.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","The government aims to ban all disposable vapes, which often comes in fruity flavours.

Beijing: Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang will visit India to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting this week, his second visit to India in two months.

“From May 2 to 5, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Qin Gang will visit Myanmar and attend the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of SCO in India,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning announced on Tuesday.
“The upcoming SCO Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held on May 4 and 5 in Panaji, the capital of Goa, India,” Mao said, adding that Qin “will exchange views with other SCO member states’ foreign ministers on the international and regional situation and SCO cooperation in various fields, among other topics, to make full preparation for this year’s SCO summit.”
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to attend SCO summit in New Delhi on July 3 and 4.






Several key meetings in the run-up to the summit have already been held in India including the national security advisers’ meeting on March 29 and the defence ministers’ meeting in late April.
Chinese defence minister Li Shangfu attended the defence ministers’ meeting in late April, which was the first visit to India by a Chinese defence minister since the Galwan Valley clash in June, 2020, and the subsequent chill in bilateral ties.
Qin visited India in early March to attend the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi where he told external affairs minister S Jaishankar that India and China should put the border problem in its “appropriate” place and ease the situation to “normalised control”.
“We should put the border issue in the appropriate place in bilateral relations and promote the early shift of the border situation to normalised control,” Qin told Jaishankar during the meeting, their first since Qin took over as China’s foreign minister, replacing Wang Yi.






“The two sides should implement the important consensus between the leaders of the two countries, maintain dialogue, settle differences, and promote the improvement of bilateral relations as soon as possible and move forward steadily,” Qin said, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout released on March 3, several hours after the bilateral meeting took place in New Delhi.
On his part, Jaishankar had described the Sino-Indian ties as “abnormal” during his talks with Qin, adding that their conversation was about the challenges in bilateral ties, especially for restoring peace and tranquillity in the border areas.
“It’s our first meeting after he took over as foreign minister. We spent maybe about 45 minutes talking to each other… about the current state of our relationship, which many of you heard me describe as ‘abnormal’ and I think those were among the adjectives I used in that meeting,” Jaishankar said, according to a report by the Press Trust of India.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is on an official visit to the Maldives, on Tuesday handed over a fast patrol vessel and landing craft assault to the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF), describing the delivery of the two indigenous vessels as a symbol of the shared commitment of the two countries towards peace and security in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

“India has emerged as a leading defence exporter in recent years. A defence manufacturing ecosystem has been created which has the advantage of abundant technical manpower. We produce world-class equipment to meet not only our own needs, but also for exports,” Singh said at the handing over ceremony attended by Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and defence minister Mariya Ahmed Didi.

India offers an enhanced defence partnership to friendly foreign countries, which is accommodative of their national priorities and capacities, he said. 
“We wish to create symbiotic relationships where we can learn from each other, grow together and create a win-win situation for all. India’s commitment to support the Maldives will only get stronger with time,” Singh said. 






The fast patrol vessel, capable of coastal and offshore surveillance at high speeds, was commissioned as MNDF Coast Guard ship Huravee. 
In the absence of a navy, the coast guard functions as the armed maritime component of the MNDF. 
The Maldives is one of the biggest beneficiaries of India’s Neighbourhood First policy. 
Singh called for enhanced cooperation among nations in the IOR to address the common challenges faced by the region. 
“The Indian Ocean is our shared space. The primary responsibility for peace, stability and prosperity in the region rests with those who live in the region. Peace and security of a region are best secured with cooperation and collaboration of the regional players.” 






Singh identified sustainable exploitation of resources and climate change as the most important common challenges faced by the IOR. He called for collaborative efforts towards ensuring that the maritime expanse of the Indian Ocean is peaceful, and the resources are optimally harnessed for regional prosperity. 
He said the Maldives was particularly exposed to the vagaries of climate change, while articulating India’s willingness to work with the country for adaptation and mitigation. 
“India has been the first responder in a large number of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) requirements in the region in the past many years. We look forward to building upon each other’s expertise by collaborative engagement,” Singh said. 
Earlier in the day, Singh called on Solih, and held discussions on ongoing projects and ways to further bolster defence ties. 






Work on developing the harbour at Uthuru Thila Falhu base under a bilateral agreement is among the ongoing projects and is aimed at creating a hub for vessel maintenance. 
In 2021, India extended a $50 million line of credit to the Maldives for defence projects, and the two countries signed a pact to develop the harbour at Uthuru Thila Falhu.
