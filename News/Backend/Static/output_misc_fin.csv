Some of India's top wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, have been on a public protest over alleged sexual harassment by Wrestling Federation India chief Brijbhushan Sharan Singh. Recently, a scuffle broke out between the protesting wrestlers and Delhi Police at Jantar Mantar in the national capital. Following this, many celebs including Gauahar Khan and Swara Bhasker tweeted in support of the wrestlers and demanded justice for them. Now, Vidyut has also weighed in on the issue.
Vidyut said in Hindi at a media interaction, “This is an important question. They are our athletes and troubled, but first, they are the citizens of the country. They should be given the required help. I think the authorities are listening to them, but what next? What are they doing about their concerns? I am an athlete and I have a feeling if they would listen to them and things will change now. They’ll do what’s right.”






On Wednesday, an argument between some wrestlers and policemen turned violent in which two wrestlers suffered injuries, as per reports. Vinesh Phogat also accused a Delhi Police personnel of using derogatory language against her. Recently, sharing a video of Vinesh and her fellow wrestlers from the protest site on Twitter, actor Gauahar Khan had urged people to 'listen to their plight'.
She had tweeted, ""If this doesn’t break your heart, then you are probably a non-living thing. These athletes have brought India pride on international levels and they are being manhandled, sad!!!!! They are fighting for justice, please listen to their plight!"" She added the hashtags 'Indian wrestlers' and 'pride' to her tweet.
Last month, actors Swara Bhasker and Sonu Sood had also tweeted in support of wrestlers protesting against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over sexual harassment allegations. Actor-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt also came out in support of the protesting wrestlers, and had slammed Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief PT Usha for criticising them. Vidyut is the latest celebrity to speak on the public protest.






In his next, Vidyut plays an Indian Air Force officer, who plans to block the airspace to prevent an attack on India by Pakistan and China. IB71 is set to be released in theatres on May 12. The espionage thriller is directed by filmmaker Sankalp Reddy. The film also features Anupam Kher and Vishal Jethwa in prominent roles.

In a new interview, veteran actor Neena Gupta spoke about young Bollywood actors being invited to international events. The actor had mixed feelings as she saw the younger generation making in big internationally. Speaking about actors such as Priyanka Chopra, Alia Bhatt and Deepika Padukone, Neena said she wished she could have received this kind of global 'exposure' back in the day. She said she feels ‘envious’ when she sees them at such events. Also read: Deepika Padukone showers love on Alia Bhatt days after her Met Gala debut, Reddit calls it ‘damage control’




Neena Gupta said she is envious of Priyanka Chopra and Alia Bhatt’s Met Gala appearance.








While Deepika Padukone was a presenter at the 95th Academy Awards, which were held in March in Los Angeles, Priyanka Chopra and Alia Bhatt made heads turn at this year’s Met Gala, which was held in New York on May 1 (May 2 in India).
Speaking about them, Neena said in an interview with News18 that she wished she was a young actor today. ""I wish we also had the same kind of exposure. I think about it every passing minute. I feel envious every second (smiles). I wonder what if I was a young actor in this day and age! I could have achieved so much more. Having said that, I know that you can’t have everything that you wish for. I definitely do feel thankful for all the work that’s coming my way even at this age. But yes, I feel very, very jealous when I look at them wearing gowns and walking [on the global stage],"" Neena said.






The actor further said that if she ever gets invited to a global event, she will wear a look put together by designer-actor Masaba Gupta, her daughter. Neena said, ""If they call me, I’m game. I don’t have the body to wear a gown. So, I’ll wear a very beautiful saree if I’m invited to go [to an international event]. But no one’s inviting me (laughs). If an opportunity comes my way, I’ve Masaba to style me.”
Neena was last seen in Mrs Chatterjee VS Norway. The actor recently wrapped up filming for Charlie Chopra & The Mystery of Solang Valley and is now shooting for Metro In Dino. She has also done a segment in Lust Stories 2, which is directed by R Balki. It will be released on June 29.

Life returned to a wary normalcy in Imphal Valley on Saturday as shops and markets reopened and cars started plying on the roads. Security presence which has been bolstered by flying in more army troops and rapid action force and central police forces was clearly visible at all major areas and roads. Most shops and markets in Imphal town and other places opened in the morning with people buying vegetables and other essential commodities even as security forces were deployed in large numbers. Of the 54 dead, 16 bodies were kept in the morgue of the Churachandpur district hospital while 15 bodies were in Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal East district, officials said. The Regional Institute of Medical Sciences at Lamphel in Imphal West district reported 23 dead, the official said. Meanwhile, five hill-based militants were killed and two India Reserve Battalion jawans were injured in two separate encounters in Churachandpur district on Friday night, police said. An encounter took place at Saiton in Churachandpur district between the security forces and the militants in which four militants were gunned down, the police said. Militants opened fire at security forces at Torbung forcing them to return the fire. In the exchange of fire one militant was killed and two IRB jawans were injured, the police said. A Defence spokesperson said a total of 13,000 people were rescued and shifted to safe shelters, some in army camps as the army brought Churachandpur, Moreh, Kakching and Kangpokpi districts under its “firm control”. “In the past 12 hours, Imphal East and West districts witnessed sporadic incidents of arson and attempts by inimical elements to establish blockades. However, the situation was controlled by a firm and synergised response,” the Defence official said on Friday night. Details of the incidents, however, were not available. Multiple sources said the fighting between communities had left several scores of people dead and nearly a hundred injured. However, the police were unwilling to confirm this. The bodies were brought from districts such as Imphal East and West, Churachandpur and Bishenpur. Many people with bullet injuries are also being treated at RIMS and Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences. “Prompt response by Security Forces led to rescuing of civilians of all communities from various minority pockets of areas affected by violence. As a result, Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, Moreh and Kakching are now under firm control with no major violence reported since yesterday night,” the PRO said. Nearly 10,000 soldiers from the Army and the Assam Rifles have been deployed in the state which was rocked by clashes since Wednesday between the Meitei community, which mainly live in Imphal Valley, and Naga and Kuki tribals who are inhabitants of the hill districts. “Total of approximately 13,000 civilians have been rescued and are currently staying in various ad-hoc boarding facilities specifically created for the purpose within Company Operating Bases & Military Garrisons,” the defence official said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the situation in Manipur with Chief Minister N Biren Singh and top officials on Friday, even as the Centre dispatched additional security forces and anti-riot vehicles to maintain peace there. Around 1,000 more central paramilitary personnel with anti-riot vehicles reached Manipur on Friday, sources said. Trains to Manipur have been cancelled with immediate effect on Friday due to the prevailing in the state, a Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) spokesperson said. Violence first erupted in Torbung area in Churachandpur district during the ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ organised by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM) on Wednesday to protest the demand of Meiteis for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. The march was organised by tribals — including Nagas and Kukis — after the Manipur High Court asked the state government last month to send a recommendation to the Centre within four weeks on the demand for ST status by the Metei community. During the march in Torbung, an armed mob allegedly attacked people of the Meitei community, leading to retaliatory attacks in the valley districts, which escalated the violence throughout the state, police said. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of the population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals, who include Nagas and Kukis, account for another 40 per cent of the population and live mostly in the hill districts which surround the Valley.

Recently, Pakistani actor Yasir Hussain spoke about Diljit Dosanjh's Coachella performance last month and India's response to his historic feat. Yasir said that in comparison, the way Pakistan reacted to Pakistani singer Ali Sethi singing at the famous music festival was disappointing. The actor wondered if the people of his country had become 'too cool' to praise their stars, who were putting the country on the global map.

Speaking about the lack of attention given to Ali Sethi, who is famous for his song Pasoori, in Pakistan, actor Yasir Hussain talked about India’s appreciation of artist Diljit Dosanjh. Taking to Instagram Stories, Yasir shared a news article about Ali’s Coachella gig and wrote, “Diljit too went to Coachella and the whole of India was appreciating him. This is also a big achievement for a Pakistani artist. But, as usual, we didn’t care much for it. Hum zara zyada cool nahi hogaye (Are we not becoming too cool now)?""



Pakistani actor Yasir Hussain spoke about Diljit Dosanjh and Ali Sethi's Coachella performance.








The Pakistani singer has been making waves since his song Pasoori was released, and it also became the most searched song on Google in 2022. At Coachella 2023, fans were seen vibing to Ali's songs as he performed during the second weekend of Coachella, one of the largest music festivals in the world, singing to a packed tent of festival-goers.
Apart from his music, Ali has also been pushing boundaries, when it comes to men’s fashion. In fact, his desi Coachella look grabbed attention on social media as some questioned his clothes for not being 'manly' enough. Last month, sharing photos of Ali wearing a white angarkha at the festival – a traditional robe with long sleeves worn – a Twitter user had asked, ""What the f*** is he even wearing though?""






Meanwhile, Diljit Dosanjh also performed for a packed audience at Coachella last month, becoming the first Punjabi artist to perform at the fest. Pictures and videos from the festival showed him making everyone groove to his music, even Diplo. He had performed Patiala Peg and Lemonade, among other songs, wearing an all-black outfit – a black turban, black sunglasses, and a pair of gloves. Fans of the singer could not be more proud of him and took to social media to praise his performance.

As a former ""Tough Enough"" winner, Lee served as an inspiration to many in the sports-entertainment world. WWE offers its heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and fans.""

Tragedy struck the Manhattan headquarters of Google when a senior software engineer jumped to his death from the 14th floor of the search giant's headquarters in Chelsea late on Thursday. The man's identity has not been revealed by the authorities, as they are yet to inform his family about the incident.

According to police sources to New York Post, multiple 911 calls were made after an unconscious person was found lying on the ground near a building on West 15th Street, opposite the 15-story Art Deco building. The police rushed to the spot and found the man unconscious. He was immediately taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Reports suggest, investigators found handprints on the ledge of a 14th-floor open-air terrace, leading them to believe that the man had jumped from there. However, they have not found any suicide note or video of the incident.
This incident comes just a few months after another Google employee, Jacob Pratt, was found dead in an apparent suicide. Pratt, who was 33 years old, was also a software engineer working at the Manhattan headquarters. He was found hanging in an apartment on West 26th Street and 6th Avenue in Chelsea on February 16th.






Google has not issued any statement regarding the incident as of now. However, the incident has once again brought to light the issue of mental health in the tech industry and the need to address it.Discussing suicides can be triggering for some. However, suicides are preventable. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).

Sanya Malhotra has bought a new house.








Earlier this week, Sanya had shared glimpses from her griha pravesh ceremony on Instagram Stories. In one of the pictures, the actor, who was dressed in a white saree, can be seen stepping into the house. ""Naya ghar,"" she wrote with the picture. She also posted a couple of photos from the puja on Instagram Stories.
Sanya, who hails from Delhi, recently started the promotion of her upcoming Kathal from her hometown. The actor will be seen in the role of police officer for the first time in Kathal.

The movie also features Rajpal Yadav in the role of a journalist.






Co-writer and director Yashowardhan Mishra said about the film, ""It is such a thrilling experience to be launching the trailer of my first film, Kathal- A Jackfruit Mystery. Through our storytelling clubbed with an ensemble of extremely hardworking and talented actors, we have created a story that will make the audiences laugh while also making sure they go away with a strong thought.

I cannot wait for the audiences to watch the film on 19th of May, streaming only on Netflix.""
Adding onto this, Oscar-winning producer Guneet Monga said, ""We at Sikhya always take pride in delivering homegrown stories that are global in their approach. We are excited to give our audiences a family entertainer, Kathal - the jackfruit mystery, this summer!

11,Trump may reinstate 'Muslim Ban' if re-elected in 2024: Report,2023-05-06,12:24 pm,Bhawana Chaudhary,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-2024-re-election-bid-includes-plans-to-reinstate-infamous-muslim-ban-add-more-countries-to-the-list-reports-101683339288559-amp.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/6_sat/img_1683354841106_279.jpg,"
Former President Donald Trump has privately told close associates that he plans to reinstate his infamous ""Muslim ban"" if he is reelected in 2024, according to US daily Rolling Stone. Trump has reportedly called the policy ""beautiful"" and has expressed interest in adding more majority-Muslim countries to the list of those banned from entering the United States.

Banning Muslims from entering the United States has been a long-standing obsession for Trump, dating back to his presidential campaign in 2015 when he called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" Just a few days after taking office in 2017, he signed an executive order banning the entry of citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days. The ban was met with chaos and confusion at U.S. airports and ports of entry, and led to a diplomatic fallout with Iraq.










Federal courts blocked the initial order, but in 2018, the Supreme Court narrowly approved a subsequent revision of the ban. President Joe Biden reversed the executive order in one of his first executive orders after taking office.
While Trump has hinted at his interest in a reinvigorated travel ban in recent speeches, the idea has not received much public scrutiny. Trump has also touted other hardline anti-immigration policies while campaigning for a potential 2024 bid, including fully securing the border and removing illegal aliens.
Former top Trump White House policy aide Stephen Miller, who helped write the executive order for the original Muslim ban, has also been pressing for a renewed ban. ""Bring back the travel ban. Now,"" Miller wrote on Twitter in August. Miller and other MAGA conservatives have focused on Afghanistan, expressing outrage when the United States took in refugees as the country fell to the Taliban in 2021.






Trump's interest in a second term is not just limited to hardline immigration policies, as he has also proposed bringing back firing squads and mass executions, fantasizing about journalists being raped in prison, and bombing Mexico. His appearance at CPAC featured a speech where he declared himself as the people's ""retribution.""

Critics of the ban have argued that it is an incoherent policy mess that ruined countless families' lives, and would only cause more chaos in the already struggling legal immigration system. It remains to be seen if Trump's plans for a renewed ban will gain any traction in his run for president in 2024.

King Charles' wife Queen Consort Camilla will be crowned with an existing crown at the coronation which has undergone a transformation owing to many controversies. Camilla, will wear a modified version of the Queen Mary's Crown during the service, according to Buckingham Palace. The changes to the crown include removal of the replica of the Kohinoor diamond, the original version of which was first set on Queen Mary's Crown in 1911.Read more: King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla: Their 50-year relationship

The diamond passed through the hands many emperors before being presented to Queen Victoria by the deputy chairman of the East India Company in the 1840s. Owing to the controversy surrounding the symbolism of the Kohinoor diamond, Camilla decided to exclude the gem from the crown she wears at the coronation as even though the UK has retained ownership of the diamond over the years, it remains a point of contention. 
According to Buckingham Palace, Camilla's decision to not commission a new crown was made, “in the interests of sustainability and efficiency” and ""the choice to adorn the crown with new jewels is part of a, “longstanding tradition that the insertion of jewels is unique to the occasion, and reflects the Consort’s individual style.”Read more: Royal fan cheekily asks King Charles to spend the night in her tent.

Camilla's crown will instead feature the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, according to Buckingham Palace. The diamonds- known as the ""Lesser stars of Africa""- are part of a group of stones discovered in 1905 in South Africa. They are controversial as the Cullinan diamond was purchased by South Africa's Transvaal government prior to being gifted to King Edward VII as a ""symbolic gesture"".

Jeffrey Epstein's private islands namely Great St. James and Little St. James are set to be turned into a resort destination by a U.S. billionaire. As per a report by npr.org, the islands were a nexus in Epstein's alleged abuse and trafficking of young women and underage girls.




Jeffrey Epstein's private islands(Twitter)








Since Epstein's death in 2019, the two islands were in limbo and now an investment firm led by billionaire Stephen Deckoff has purchased the two islands for $60 million. Interestingly, the buying price is much lesser than $110 million for which the two properties were recently listed.

The two islands are located near St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The islands played a significant role in the legal proceedings against Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Little St. James, in particular, was frequently mentioned in court documents as the location where many young girls alleged to have been transported by private plane and coerced into engaging in sexual activities with Epstein and other men.






The buyer, Deckoff says that he plans to turn the islands into a ""world-class destination"". He has promised to turn the economic fortunes of the region without destroying the natural beauty.
“Mr. Deckoff plans to develop a state-of-the-art, five-star, world-class luxury 25-room resort that will help bolster tourism, create jobs, and spur economic development in the region, while respecting and preserving the important environment of the islands,” according to a press release about the sale.
In December of last year, a settlement worth $105 million was reached, as per which the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands would receive 50% of the earnings from the sale of Little St. James. This money will be used to establish a trust that will provide support services and counseling for the women who suffered from sexual abuse and human trafficking.






Little St. James covers approximately 71.6 acres of land and boasts several facilities such as a private helipad, dock, gas station, advanced water filtration system, two swimming pools, the main residence, four guest villas, three secluded beaches, a fitness center, a traditional Tiki hut, and several other structures, as indicated in its real estate advertisement.

""The Master Of Distortion and Incitement (‘Abuse’ No. 92??) is arriving in Bengaluru today. We already know what he'll say to inflame prejudice & bigotry. He will of course stay absolutely silent on the real issues..."" he tweeted before.




The tweet highlighted four issues the Congress has flagged in the campaign so far - allegations Karnataka ministers and government officials command a 40 per cent 'commission' to grant projects, the price rise, unemployment and the poor condition of Bengaluru's infrastructure; the last is a perennial problem.

""This time the despair is so high that his (Modi's) #40km40percent roadshow over 2 days is locking up an entire city, creating chaos and uncertainty for students writing crucial exams, and felling a number of trees…"" 
""Have you ever seen a PM this desperate?"" Jairam Ramesh asked.
The BJP and the Congress have grabbed most of the headlines in the run up to Wednesday's election, with insults and allegations thrown by both sides.
This morning the Congress said it had audio evidence of a 'plot' to assassinate party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and his family. ""Plotting to assassinate the president of Congress Shri Mallikarjun Kharge, his wife and his children..."" Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala tweeted with the audio clip.

The Congress has accused a BJP MP - Manikanta Rathod from the Chitapur constituency in Karnataka's Kalaburagi district - of orchestrating the plot.
Hindustan Times cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio clip.
The BJP has yet to respond to the Congress' 'assassinate Kharge' claims.

The two sides also spat venom at each other over Kharge's comment about poisonous snakes and prime minister Modi; the Congress chief appeared to call Modi a snake in Kolar but later said he was referring to the BJP's ideology. Modi hit back claiming the Congress hates him because he is anti-corruption.

The BJP then launched its own 'poison' barb with a Karnataka BJP MLA Basanagouda Yatnal calling ex-Congress chief Sonia Gandhi ‘vishe kanya’.

The exchange of insults prompted the Election Commission to 'warn' both sides against the use of 'inappropriate vocabulary and language'.
Karnataka will vote for a new government in a single phase on May 10, with results due three days later. The election - and those in the key states of Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao's Telangana - are seen as major tests of the BJP's bid next year to win a third consecutive Lok Sabha election.With input from agencies

India's star batter KL Rahul confirmed on Friday that he would miss the World Test Championship final against Australia next month after picking a hamstring injury during the 2023 Indian Premier League. Rahul injured his hamstring after he dived to stop a boundary during Lucknow Super Giants' match against Royal Challengers Bangalore earlier this month, and while he did come to bat following the ninth wicket of LSG's innings, he had visible discomfort in running between the wickets.

Rahul was widely seen as India's potential wicketkeeper-batter option for the title clash against Australia in June, even with KS Bharat being in the squad as the first-choice keeper. However, former Indian batter Amol Muzumdar believes that Rahul was never an option because the English conditions are harder for a wicketkeeper. Interestingly, Muzumdar dropped Ishan Kishan's name as the player who could potentially make into the XI.Also read: John Cena's blockbuster reaction to MS Dhoni's 'you can't see me' gesture during IPL 2023
“I'll stick with what I said. You need genuine keeper who can bat a little. KL Rahul was never an option, for me, at least, in Test matches. It's okay for T20 or a fifty-over match, but for Test – especially in England – where the ball nibbles around, you need a genuine keeper,” Muzumdar told ESPNCricinfo.






“Looking at the situation, what has happened to Rahul is unfortunate. But I would be inclined to include Ishan Kishan in the team, looking at his form. Why we talked about KL Rahul and KS Bharat… is because of the unfortunate incident to Rishabh Pant. Now, if you want a man-to-man replacement, you can't get any closer to Pant than Ishan Kishan. So, he comes into my team. He should be included,” Muzumdar further said.
The Indian domestic veteran did, however, insisted that he would look at all the possible options closely during the nets in days before the WTC Final to take a final call on the XI. The final takes place between June 7-11 at the Oval in London.

Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri has given the team of The Kerala Story a 'bad news' a day after its release. Taking to Twitter on Saturday, Vivek penned a long note in which he told film's producer Vipul Shah, director Sudipto Sen and actor Adah Sharma that their lives henceforth 'will not be the same'. He warned that they will 'receive unimaginable hate, feel suffocated, get confused and demoralised'. (Also Read | The Kerala Story box office day 1 collection: Sudipto Sen's film earns over ₹8 crore amid controversy)




Vivek Agnihotri has given a warning to The Kerala Story's team.








Vivek tweeted, “CINEMA AND INDIC RENNIASANCE: The Kerala Story. I grew up listening to great filmmakers and cinema critics that the only purpose of art is to provoke people into questioning their own beliefs and biases. I also grew up listening that cinema reflects the reality of a society. I was told that cinema must destroy old Gods and create new Gods.”
He also said, “I have come to realise that in modern times cinema has the power to do what media and politics can’t do. It can present uncomfortable reality, correct history, fight culture war and also become the soft power of a nation for larger interest. In India, making such cinema is not easy. I tried it with Buddha in A Traffic Jam, The Tashkent Files and The Kashmir Files. I have been physically, professionally, socially and psychologically assaulted.”










""Even my forthcoming film The Vaccine War, a positive film, celebrating India’s greatest achievement, is constantly being attacked. Mostly by the same people who taught me all the above. When it releases, later this year, I can guarantee they will attack it with a new design because they don’t want India to succeed. Because Truth must not be told. Bharat must not be celebrated,"" added the filmmaker.






Vivek continued to speak about ‘enemies of truth’, justice and Dharma. ""Dear Vipul Shah & @sudiptoSENtlm, @adah_sharma and team of #TheKeralaStory, first let me congratulate you for the brave effort. At the same time, let me also give you the bad news that from here on, your lives will not be the same. You will receive unimaginable hate. Your will feel suffocated. Many times you may get confused and demoralised. But remember, God tests the shoulders on which he can put the responsibility of becoming the change agents,"" he tweeted.
""If cinema is a medium to follow your course of Dharma, never stop. Let the community of Indic storytellers grow. Help new, young talented, Indic storytellers. Let this Indic Renaissance become the guiding light of a New Bharat. And whenever you feel nobody is understanding you, remember Gurudev’s lines: Ekla Chalo Re (Go forward alone). Best. Always. With love, VRA,"" concluded his post.






The Kerala Story has been written and directed by Sudipto Sen and stars Adah Sharma, Yogita Bihani, Siddhi Idnani and Sonia Balani in the lead roles. A row started when the trailer claimed that 32,000 girls from the state went missing and later joined the terrorist group, ISIS. The Kerala High Court on Friday noted that the producers have published a disclaimer which said that the film has fictionalised and is a dramatised version of events and that the film doesn't claim accuracy or factuality of historic events.

Protesters wore yellow t-shirts to stand out and held up signs saying ""Not My King"".They spent most of the service booing or singing songs such as ""he is just a normal man"".But London police had warned they would take action if protesters tried to ""obstruct the enjoyment and celebration"" of the day, and they formed a ring around the group.Republic said its leader Graham Smith had been detained on Saturday morning and a photo posted on Twitter showed him sitting on the ground surrounded by police officers.""It is disgusting and massively over the top,"" said Kevin John, 57, a salesman from Devon who was among the protesters.""It is also hugely counterproductive by the police because all it has done is create a massive amount of publicity for us. It is completely crazy.""Police did not confirm Smith's arrest but said they had arrested four people on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and three people on suspicion of possessing articles to cause criminal damage in what they called a ""significant police operation"".Republic said hundreds of its placards had been seized.Protests also took place in Glasgow in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales, with signs held up saying: ""Abolish the monarchy, feed the people."" On social media, many contrasted the cost of living crisis in Britain with the pomp and pageantry on display at the coronation.Although the protesters were in a minority compared with the tens of thousands gathered on London’s streets to support the king, polls suggest support for the monarchy is declining and is weakest among young people.With the crown passing from Queen Elizabeth to her less popular son, republican activists hope Charles will be the last British monarch to be crowned.[1/7] Protesters hold placards as people gather on the day of Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation ceremony, in London, Britain May 6, 2023. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/Pool""It has a hereditary billionaire individual born into wealth and privilege who basically symbolises the inequality of wealth and power in our society,"" said lawmaker Clive Lewis, who was among the anti-monarchy protesters.In London, protesters demanded an elected head of state. They say that the royal family has no place in a modern constitutional democracy and is staggeringly expensive to maintain.Most of the anti-monarchy protesters on Saturday had congregated in Trafalgar Square next to the bronze statue of King Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649, leading to a short-lived republic.Some held up signs saying ""privatise them"" and ""abolish the monarchy, not the right to protest"".Other signs featured a picture of Meghan, the wife of Charles' son Prince Harry, with the words ""the people's princess"", and ""God Save the King"" with a picture of the late soccer great Pele.Since Charles became king last September, there have been protests at royal events. He was heckled at a Commonwealth Day event at Westminster Abbey in March and targeted with eggs in York in November.The death of the queen has also reignited debate in other parts of the world, such as Australia and Jamaica, about the need to retain Charles as their head of state.The state government of New South Wales said it had decided not to light up the sails of the Sydney Opera House to mark the coronation, in order to save money.While many other European monarchies have come and gone, or are far diminished in scale and importance, the British royal family has remained remarkably resilient.In Britain, polls show the majority of the population still want the royal family, but there is a long-term trend of declining support.A poll by YouGov last month found 64% of people in Britain said they had little or no interest in the coronation. Among those aged 18 to 24, the number voicing little or no interest rose to 75%.More than 11,000 police officers are on patrol for the coronation, the biggest ceremonial event staged in the British capital for 70 years.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Police arrest the leader of the anti-monarchy group Republic hours before King Charles' coronation.

“Livestreaming that we are doing, has a flip side…we as judges need to be trained ourselves, because we are now working in the age of social media. Every word we say in the court, is up on the public realm,” said CJI Chandrachud, according to PTI. He was delivering a speech at the inauguration ceremony of Neutral Citation for the Indian Judiciary and National Conference on Digitization, in Bhubaneswar.










The CJI continued: “Today, most high courts are doing livestreaming on YouTube…you have these little clips about a judge in the Patna high court asking an IAS officer as to why he was not appropriately dressed in a suit, as opposed to being dressed only in a shirt and a trouser. Or somebody in the Gujarat high court saying something about, you know, why a lawyer is not ready with her cases. So, a lot of funny stuff is going on the YouTube, which we need to control. This is serious stuff…what happens in a court is extremely serious stuff.”Livestreaming of Supreme Court proceedings
In September last year, for the first time in its history, the apex court began livestreaming of the hearing of cases. In September 2018, then-CJI Dipak Misra had passed a landmark ruling regarding the live broadcasting of important cases, saying, ""sunlight is the best disinfectant.'






For those interested, the top court broadcasts hearings on its website, as well as YouTube channel.

The Kerala Story, which found itself engulfed in controversies, has earned over ₹8 crore at the domestic box office. The film which released in cinemas on Friday has been written and directed by Sudipto Sen. The Kerala Story stars Adah Sharma, Yogita Bihani, Siddhi Idnani and Sonia Balani in the lead roles.

The official poster of The Kerala Story which released on May 5.








According to the makers, The Kerala Story unearths the events behind approximately 32,000 women going missing in Kerala who are converted, and deployed in terror missions in India and the world. The Kerala Story is backed by Sunshine Pictures Private Limited, founded by Vipul Amrutlal Shah, who serves as the producer, creative director and co-writer on the film.
Taking to Twitter on Saturday, film analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted, ""#TheKeralaStory hits the ball out of the stadium… Takes a SMASHING START… Evening + night shows witness solid occupancy… The Day 1 numbers are an EYE-OPENER for the entire industry… TERRIFIC weekend assured… Fri ₹ 8.03 cr. #India biz. #Boxoffice.""










The trailer of the film came under fire as it claimed that 32,000 girls from the state went missing and later joined the terrorist group, ISIS. The Kerala Story became a topic for discussion around the numbers being exaggerated in the trailer of the film. The Kerala High Court noted on Friday that the producers have published a disclaimer along with the movie which specifically says that the film has fictionalised and is a dramatised version of events and that the film doesn't claim accuracy or factuality of historic events.
Recently, Sudipto opened up on The Kerala Story at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). As quoted by news agency ANI, he said, ""People should watch it, if you like it, it will be the biggest prize for me. I take my film to Vipul (producer Vipul Amrutlal Shah). He liked the story. He was in tears. Then we decided to make the film and it's been a long seven-year journey after which we finally managed to complete the film.""






Talking about the film ahead of its release, theatre owners in Kerala said that bookings were average, despite the huge adverse publicity generated by it. Suresh Shenoy, who runs eight theatres in Kochi including the Shenoy's multiplex, told news agency PTI, ""We do not expect any kind of protests against the film. It is unlikely."" He said that the film, which will be screened at the multiplex he owns, has received average bookings as expected from a ""small Hindi film like this"".

On Saturday, the actor posted a video of herself undergoing cryotherapy in a snow-covered location. Her video has left fans praising her even more.

Rakul Preet Singh undergoes cryotherapy.








The video starts at a snow-covered area, where Rakul and a group of people are seen in thick coats and other winterwear before they get inside a wooden cabin. The actor walks out of the cabin in swimwear only. She proceeds to take a dip in a pool of freezing water.
The temperature of the surrounding was minus 15 degree Celsius. Even in the harsh weather, she maintains her smile as she gets up from the water and returns to the cabin. Sharing the video, Rakul wrote in the caption, “Cryo in -15 (degree Celsius) anyone?”










Reacting to the video, a fan wrote in the comment section, “Proof that she is too hot...” A fan also said, “Rakul ne thu pani me aag lagadi (she has set the water on fire)."" One more commented, “For a movie you are doing this?”
Rakul was last seen in Chhatriwali. In the film, she plays a condom seller, who hides her profession due to the stigma attached to it. While it received mixed reviews, many also called the film title cringe. When asked about the same, she told Hindustan Times, “This has taken from society.”
“You must be aware that condoms are called helmet, chhatri, raincoat, and God knows what all names. Now the connotation came from there, she is working at an umbrella factory and now she is called Chhatriwali. I don’t understand what is cringy in Chhatriwali? It’s the mind. The thought process begins from the mind. If your mind is not in the right place you will find things a little off or cringy. Duniya toh aise hi bolti hai na toh unko usi language me sikha rahe hai (We are using a language which they understand). You can’t title the film condom tester. Then they will say aisa kaise title rakh diya,” she added.






She will be next seen in Indian 2 along with Kamal Hassan. She is also a part of Meri Patni Ka Remake, alongside Ayalaan.

The role of the monarchy has been controversial in Australia as the country held a referendum in 1999 on becoming a republic. Then, 55% of voters opposed, although recent polls showed decreased level of supports for the monarchy. 
Many public buildings and monuments, including Parliament House in Canberra, will be illuminated in royal purple to mark the coronation. The Sydney Opera House was lit up in September to pay respect to Queen Elizabeth II following her death. 
""The New South Wales Government believe it has struck the right balance in terms of meeting community expectations on commemorating the occasion while being mindful of public expense,"" the government spokesperson said.Read more: On multi-faith coronation, UK PM Rishi Sunak says, 'moment of pride'






This comes as Australian PM Anthony Albanese arrived in London for the coronation. 
""I want to see an Australian as Australia's head of state ... That doesn't mean that you can not have respect for the institution, which is the system of government that we have"", he said.
In addition to Australia, King Charles is the head of state in New Zealand and 12 other Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom.
