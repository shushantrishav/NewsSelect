Amid the row over Adah Sharma's The Kerala Story for its claims on the indoctrination of women in ISIS in Kerala, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma made it an election issue in Karnataka. Addressing a rally in the poll-bound state on Friday, Himanta referred to the Congress manifesto of banning the Bajrang Dal if voted to power and said, ""Does Bajrang Dal do any bomb blast? No. How will you ban Bajrang Dal? What is your friendship with the PFI that you are acting like their spokesperson?""

""There is a new film The Kerala Story which reveals many things. When the BBC made a film on Modiji making false claims, the Congress was in favour of it. But today the same Congress wants a ban on The Kerala Story,"" Himanta said. The BBC documentary on Gujarat riots India: The Modi Question was at the centre of a controversy early this year after it was blocked from airing in India. 
""Congress can't give any guarantee as Rahul Gandhi has no guarantee,"" Himanta said.
Earlier on Friday, PM Modi referred to The Kerala Story as he said in Karnataka: ""Such a beautiful state of the country, where people are hardworking and talented. The ‘Kerala Story’ film brings out terror conspiracies happening in that state. It is unfortunate that Congress can be seen standing with this terror trend that is seeking to ruin the country. Congress is even indulging in backdoor political bargaining with people having terror inclinations. People of Karnataka should be cautious about Congress.""






The Kerala Story released on Friday, sparking off a controversy as special screenings are being organised in many areas by BJP workers. Kerala Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan slammed the movie before its release and called it Sangh propaganda while the Congress too spoke against the movie for its ""exaggeration"".
The Kerala high court on Friday refused to stay the release of the movie and said the trailer has nothing offensive. The disclaimer says that the film is a dramatised version of events, the high court noted.Row over teaser claim of '32,000 women'
The teaser of the Sudipto Sen movie claims over 32,000 women from Kerala were recruited by the IS. Facing flak for the number, the producer has agreed to remove the teaser will be removed from social media.

More than 25.60 lakh people have benefited from these clinics, he added.Mann said opponents target AAP for giving free power, free treatment and free education to people.“We say when leaders get free power, when exchequer bears all their medical expenses, why cannot it be done for the common people too,” he said.With the launch of the new clinics, the total number of these health facilities in Punjab has reached 580.Speaking at the event, Kejriwal said an “honest government” in Punjab is making opponents jittery.“We have been in power for just one year in Punjab but work is being done at a great pace,” he said.“Punjab is making quick progress. For 75 years, people only saw loot and for the first time the state is touching heights of development,” the AAP national convener said, alleging previous governments only signed MoUs during investments summits but no investments came and no jobs were generated.Mann, however, took pains and brought Rs 40,000 crore worth investments to Punjab, Kejriwal said.The Mann government has already given 29,000 government jobs to people, he claimed.Kejriwal said like Delhi, parents in Punjab too will remove their children from private schools and send them to government institutions.Mentioning the arrest of former Punjab minister Sunder Sham Arora in October last year, Mann said his government is going after those who have “looted” Punjab.“We arrested the former industry minister. When his house was searched, sofa sets worth Rs 10 lakh, bath fittings worth Rs 15 lakh, costly fans, other expensive items were found,” he said.The Punjab Vigilance Bureau arrested Arora for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs 50 lakh to its officer to settle cases against him.Taking on former chief minister Amarinder Singh, Mann said the BJP leader says Bhagwant Mann lacks experience.“I want to tell Amarinder Singh that people were fed up with experienced leaders like you. When he became CM, he remained inaccessible to people and what people later did was to confine him in his palace and oust him (from power),” said Mann.

However, questions were raised about the absence of nephew Ajit Pawar from the press meet. When asked about this, Pawar Sr. replied, ""Everyone can't be present in one press conference. Some of the people are here and some others are not. But this morning, senior leaders of the party, took a decision unanimously and made me aware of it"".
“Everyone expressed their sentiments through that decision. So, raising a question as to who is present here and who isn't or looking for meaning into this, is not correct”, he added.“Others are here. Committee took this decision and after their decision, I took my decision back. All are united and discussed this. Senior leaders are there in the committee”, the veteran leader said.










On the day Pawar had announced his resignation, the party cadre had urged him to take it back. But nephew Ajit was the one who had supported the decision.“Pawar Saheb himself had said about the necessity of change in guard a few days back. We should see his decision in the light of his age and health also. Everyone has to take a decision according to time, Pawar Saheb has taken a decision and he won't take it back”, he had said.Ajit Pawar, who had staged an unsuccessful coup against his uncle in 2019 by joining the short-lived government of Devendra Fadnavis, is back in focus. There had been reports of the ambitious nephew holding meeting MLAs supporting him but Pawar managed to prevail over the situation.

Congress comms-in-charge Jairam Ramesh ripped into prime minister Narendra Modi Saturday as the latter led a massive roadshow in Bengaluru in poll-bound Karnataka. The opposition leader labelled Modi 'the master of distortion' and his jab 'abuse' No. 92??' - a sarcastic reference to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's claims the prime minister is being 'targeted' by the Congress in a shrill and high-pitched battle for the control of the state. Ramesh also stopped short of accusing the prime minister of 'hate speech', declaring Modi's remarks at a rally scheduled for later today would only 'inflame prejudice and bigotry'.

""The Master Of Distortion and Incitement (‘Abuse’ No. 92??) is arriving in Bengaluru today. We already know what he'll say to inflame prejudice & bigotry. He will of course stay absolutely silent on the real issues..."" he tweeted before.




The tweet highlighted four issues the Congress has flagged in the campaign so far - allegations Karnataka ministers and government officials command a 40 per cent 'commission' to grant projects, the price rise, unemployment and the poor condition of Bengaluru's infrastructure; the last is a perennial problem.

""This time the despair is so high that his (Modi's) #40km40percent roadshow over 2 days is locking up an entire city, creating chaos and uncertainty for students writing crucial exams, and felling a number of trees…"" 
""Have you ever seen a PM this desperate?"" Jairam Ramesh asked.
The BJP and the Congress have grabbed most of the headlines in the run up to Wednesday's election, with insults and allegations thrown by both sides.
This morning the Congress said it had audio evidence of a 'plot' to assassinate party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and his family. ""Plotting to assassinate the president of Congress Shri Mallikarjun Kharge, his wife and his children..."" Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala tweeted with the audio clip.

The Congress has accused a BJP MP - Manikanta Rathod from the Chitapur constituency in Karnataka's Kalaburagi district - of orchestrating the plot.
Hindustan Times cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio clip.
The BJP has yet to respond to the Congress' 'assassinate Kharge' claims.

The two sides also spat venom at each other over Kharge's comment about poisonous snakes and prime minister Modi; the Congress chief appeared to call Modi a snake in Kolar but later said he was referring to the BJP's ideology. Modi hit back claiming the Congress hates him because he is anti-corruption.

The BJP then launched its own 'poison' barb with a Karnataka BJP MLA Basanagouda Yatnal calling ex-Congress chief Sonia Gandhi ‘vishe kanya’.

The exchange of insults prompted the Election Commission to 'warn' both sides against the use of 'inappropriate vocabulary and language'.
Karnataka will vote for a new government in a single phase on May 10, with results due three days later. The election - and those in the key states of Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao's Telangana - are seen as major tests of the BJP's bid next year to win a third consecutive Lok Sabha election.With input from agencies

The Congress on Saturday hit out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Jagat Pratap Nadda for criticising India of the past, asking “why such hatred towards the country.” Addressing an election rally in poll-bound Karnataka's Kuppal district on Friday, Nadda said India was earlier known for corruption but now the country's identity has changed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule.

""How was India 9 years ago? Earlier, India was known for corruption. Earlier, India used to surrender and was indecisive. Now under PM Modi, G20 and SCO meetings are being held in India, Prime Ministers, ministers, and foreign ministers from all over the world are coming. PM Modi has created this identity of India"", he said.
Reacting to Nadda's remarks, Congress media department head Pawan Khera said, “Why such hatred towards the country?”
“There must be a reason that our elders had always kept you out of power,” the wrote on Twitter. “Shame on such an anti-national mentality.”










During his address, Nadda attacked the Congress's campaign around anti-corruption saying half of the party leaders are in jail while the other half are on bail and they are talking about corruption.
""Rahul Gandhi is on bail, Sonia Gandhi is on bail and DK Shivakumar is on bail. Half on bail, half in jail and they talk about corruption"", Nadda said.
Nadda further said, “You (Congress) withdrew cases against PFI, you demand a ban on Bajrang Dal, you are involved in corruption, and you put a break in development work. That's why remember this if you vote for Congress, then you are voting for PFI's return.”
Karnataka will go to polls on May 10 and the counting of votes will take place on May 13.

Actor Vidyut Jammwal, who is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie IB71, spoke about the ongoing wrestlers' protest in Delhi. During a media interaction on Friday, the actor said that even though people were hearing the wrestlers’ concerns, nobody was doing anything about it.

Some of India's top wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, have been on a public protest over alleged sexual harassment by Wrestling Federation India chief Brijbhushan Sharan Singh. Recently, a scuffle broke out between the protesting wrestlers and Delhi Police at Jantar Mantar in the national capital. Following this, many celebs including Gauahar Khan and Swara Bhasker tweeted in support of the wrestlers and demanded justice for them. Now, Vidyut has also weighed in on the issue.
Vidyut said in Hindi at a media interaction, “This is an important question. They are our athletes and troubled, but first, they are the citizens of the country. They should be given the required help. I think the authorities are listening to them, but what next? What are they doing about their concerns? I am an athlete and I have a feeling if they would listen to them and things will change now. They’ll do what’s right.”






On Wednesday, an argument between some wrestlers and policemen turned violent in which two wrestlers suffered injuries, as per reports. Vinesh Phogat also accused a Delhi Police personnel of using derogatory language against her. Recently, sharing a video of Vinesh and her fellow wrestlers from the protest site on Twitter, actor Gauahar Khan had urged people to 'listen to their plight'.
She had tweeted, ""If this doesn’t break your heart, then you are probably a non-living thing. These athletes have brought India pride on international levels and they are being manhandled, sad!!!!! They are fighting for justice, please listen to their plight!"" She added the hashtags 'Indian wrestlers' and 'pride' to her tweet.
Last month, actors Swara Bhasker and Sonu Sood had also tweeted in support of wrestlers protesting against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over sexual harassment allegations. Actor-filmmaker Pooja Bhatt also came out in support of the protesting wrestlers, and had slammed Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief PT Usha for criticising them. Vidyut is the latest celebrity to speak on the public protest.






In his next, Vidyut plays an Indian Air Force officer, who plans to block the airspace to prevent an attack on India by Pakistan and China. IB71 is set to be released in theatres on May 12. The espionage thriller is directed by filmmaker Sankalp Reddy. The film also features Anupam Kher and Vishal Jethwa in prominent roles.

Star Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia on Friday made an emotional appeal to citizens seeking their support in the ongoing protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar over sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.




Wrestlers Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Mallik address the press conference in the ongoing protest against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, at Jantar Mantar, in New Delhi on Thursday.(ANI)








Posting a video featuring him and fellow grapplers Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, Punia wrote on Twitter, “We fought for the pride of our country. Today we are fighting for the safety and honour of your champions. Please support us!”
Punia's appeal came a day after a large number of people, including farmers from neighbouring states of Delhi and DU students, reached Jantar Mantar and expressed solidarity with the wrestlers who are demanding the arrest of WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.










Many of them raised slogans like ""Nari Shakti Zindabad"", ""Pahalwan Ekta Zindabad"", ""Jo Humse Takrayega, Chur Chur Hojayega"" in support of the aggrieved wrestlers amid heavy security deployment at the protest site. Several farmer groups, who came from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, shouted ""Jai Kisan Jai Jawan"" and ""Kisan Ekta Zindabad"", pledging to not leave the site until justice is delivered to the wrestlers, reported PTI.
""After what happened with our wrestlers on Wednesday night, we felt the need to come and extend our support to the daughters of this country who have won medals for India at international platform. What happened yesterday was unfortunate. We have decided that until justice is delivered to them, we will not move from here,"" said Balbir Singh, a farmer who came from Amritsar.What happened on Wednesday night?






A scuffle broke out between the wrestlers and some police personnel when the protesters were trying to get extra mattresses and wooden benches to the protest site for their night stay since rain had left old mattresses wet and soggy. Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik claimed that they were abused and pushed by male police officers, leaving them in tears.
The Delhi Police has denied the allegation that its personnel used force against the protesting wrestlers.

RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav on Friday reacted on the Patna high court's order to put an interim stay on the enumeration of castes and economic survey in Bihar, saying that whoever is against it is “against equality and humanity”.

“The one who is against caste enumeration is a supporter of poverty, unemployment, backwardness, social and economic discrimination,” Lalu Yadav wrote in a tweet.Also read: Caste census in last stage, halting it will cause loss to exchequer: Bihar govt to HC
Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the RJD supremo asked, “Why is the BJP afraid of counting the majority of backward castes?” “The people of the country have understood the devious trick and cleverness of the BJP on the caste census,” he added.










On Thursday, the Patna high court issued an interim order staying Bihar’s caste-based survey - which was launched in January - saying prima facie the state government has no power to carry it out. A division bench of Chief Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice Madhuresh Prasad directed the authorities to secure the data collected as part of a two-phased enumeration exercise.
The court has fixed July 7 as the next date for the hearing of petitions against the survey.Also read: Kharge's letter to Modi as Rahul Gandhi dares on caste census: ‘I am afraid…’
Meanwhile, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has maintained that the state is not conducting a caste census but only collecting information related to people’s economic status in order to serve them better.






Kumar on Thursday said, “I cannot understand, why people have a problem with the survey. The last time a headcount was done was way back in 1931. We certainly have a fresh estimate. After all, the census takes into account respective populations of minorities, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes every ten years.”

12,Sharad Pawar's leadership important for Opposition unity: Raut,2023-05-05,06:11 pm,Apoorva Shankar,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-resignation-ncp-sanjay-raut-uddhav-thackeray-faction-101683284001387-amp.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/5_fri/img_1683288812381_613.jpg,"
Hours after the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) panel, selected by Sharad Pawar rejected his resignation, Uddhav Thackeray faction leader Sanjay Raut on Friday said that the veteran leader's leadership is important for the unity of opposition parties.

“Someone who since the day they entered politics has been working towards social and political welfare. That politician is only a true politician then… The committee that was set up to make a decision, they did not have any other solution That is why they went back to Pawar sahab and asked him to continue his leadership of the party"", Raut said. “All opposition party leaders, including Uddhav Thackeray ji, expressed their feelings to Sharad Pawar saying the country needs him. This kind of politics being played in the country, especially about the talk of opposition unity, would require a leader and politician like Pawar sahab”, he added.










Raut further said, ""If Pawar sahab does not remain the chief of NCP, it would affect the party. If a big political party's leader, especially someone like Pawar sahab who is widely respected, does not remain chief of the party, it obviously affects the party.
Speaking about the role of central agencies in Pawar's resignation, Raut said, “All opposition leaders are under pressure. The Centre and central agencies want opposition parties to diminish and more opposition leaders to join the BJP party. This kind of pressure, I have heard, has been put on several NCP leaders along with Shiv Sena leaders.”
The NCP early on Friday passed a resolution rejecting Sharad Pawar's resignation as party president and has requested him to continue to lead the party that he founded, senior NCP Praful Patel said after the party's core committee meeting to choose its next chief.






The decision was taken days after Sharad Pawar dropped a bombshell saying he would step down from the post. Celebrations by NCP party workers erupted soon after senior Patel announced the committee's decision at a press conference.
“Mr Pawar expressed his desire to step down as president of the party. We unanimously reject the resignation. We have decided unanimously that we will request him to carry on as party president,” Patel said at the press conference.

Be alert, be safe,” he added.“The Kerala Story”, starring Adah Sharma, is written and directed by Sudipto Sen.The movie is portrayed as “unearthing” the events behind “approximately 32,000 women” allegedly going missing from Kerala.The plot follows the story of a group of women from Kerala who are converted to Islam and later forced to join terror group ISIS.The filmmakers claim that the movie is a compilation of true stories of three young girls from different parts of Kerala.When asked why he feels that the movie should be shown to girls, Mishra told PTI, “Firstly, love jihad is an insult to love. Secondly, they are making our children anti-national.” Everyone is free to practice their religion but it is unacceptable to subject others to physical exploitation and push them onto the wrong path, the BJP leader said.Extremists among Muslims fund such acts and the movie needs to be shown to girls to raise awareness about the issue, he said.“We have to save our daughters from this,” said Mishra, a former national general secretary of the BJP Yuva Morcha.Many petitions have been filed seeking a ban on the screening of the movie. The Supreme Court and the Kerala High Court have dismissed all such pleas so far. PTI ABN SKY DIV DIVThis report is auto-generated from PTI news service.

The Congress party has issued a “national advisory” in mockery of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Slamming Modi for his “busy campaigning” ahead of the Karnataka elections, Congress wrote on its Twitter handle, ""National Advisory: PM Modi is busy campaigning for the Karnataka elections. If you have a problem or your state is in turmoil, just be ""Aatmanirbhar"" and find solutions on your own.""

“In view of the hon'able PM's visit to Bengaluru for the Karnataka elections, citizens of other states, regardless of which party they voted for are requested to govern themselves… The following issues will remain unaddressed until vote counting concludes on 13th May - Manipur Burning, Wrestlers' Protest, Poonch Terror Attack, Crony Capitalism, Economic Slowdown, Unchecked Price Rise, Corruption…” it lists out.










The Congress' mockery of the PM comes amid his campaigns in the poll-bound state of Karnataka and the deteriorating condition of Manipur. Slamming PM Modi, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, “Modiji you are an elected prime minister of the country and the people of Karnataka are also watching what is happening in Manipur and want that you should save Manipur from burning and restore peace in the state first,” said Shrinate.
“This is a fit case where Home Minister of India Amit Shah should resign or should be sacked forthwith. This is a fit case where the BJP government in Manipur should be dismissed and Article 356, that is President's rule, should be imposed,” she added.






Meanwhile, the Manipur government on May 4 issued a shoot-at-sight order in “extreme cases,” as escalating violence following a tribal solidarity march displaced more than 9,000 people in the state. Scheduled Tribe communities, mostly from the Kuki-Zomi tribal group, are protesting against a move to grant the Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to the Meitei community, which makes up the majority of Manipur's population.

Union Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Anurag Thakur, on Friday slammed those opposing the film “The Kerala Story” and called the movie “an eye-opener.” Thakur said that “freedom of expression is very selective for such groups of selective outrage.”




A banner from The Kerala Story’ film,(HT File Photo)








“This ecosystem reacts in a typical pattern whenever any film/research work brings out some chilling and untold stories like #TheKeralaStory. This chaotic ecosystem, which is so angry and desperate, tried to create similar narratives against ‘The Kashmir Files’ to hush up the genocide of Hindus by Pakistan sponsored terrorists in J&K”, he tweeted.
""Freedom of expression is very selective for such groups of selective outrage. ‘The Kerala Story’ is an eye-opener; it is time to save Kerala and our brothers and sisters from the monster of terrorism,"" the minister added.










The minister's reaction comes a day after Communist Party of India (CPI) Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam wrote to him claiming that the film is based on “Islamophobic propaganda” and intends to malign the image of Kerala.
“The film claims to unearth the story of 32000 women who went missing from the state of Kerala. This claim is based on lies and extrapolations… I urge you to initiate and enquiry into the fallacious claims made through the movie. Makers should corroborate their narrate with facts before the movie is released…” he wrote.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a rally in poll-bound Karnataka's Ballari, invoked the film. “'The Kerala Story' film is based on a terror conspiracy. It shows the ugly truth of terrorism and exposes terrorists' design. Congress is opposing the film made on terrorism and standing with terror tendencies. Congress has shielded terrorism for the vote bank”, he said.






Meanwhile, the Kerala HC which is hearing the petitions against the film had refused to stay its release observing that the film is “inspired by true events.” “There is something called freedom of speech and expression. They have artistic freedom, we have to balance that also,” Live Law quoted Justice Nagaresh as saying.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has in his book fondly mentioned his driver 'Gama', who has been taking him to various parts of Maharashtra for the last 43 years. 




NCP chief Sharad Pawar.(PTI)








In his revised autobiography 'Lok Majhe Sangati’ launched on Tuesday, Pawar lauded Gama for never causing any accident and never speaking about the leader's interactions with prominent personalities and politicians while travelling in his vehicle. ""I have found some very close colleagues in my successful public life including my personal driver Gama, who has been with me for the last 43 years. 
He has taken me to all the corners of the state, but we never met with an accident. It underscores how seriously he has taken his responsibility,” he wrote. Pawar said to save time and its better utilisation, he takes senior politicians, industrialists, reputed personalities and party officials along with him during his journeys. 
""I have openly discussed many sensitive issues with them, but Gama has earned my trust that not a single word will go out,"" he said. “Gama is at times my guardian as well. He takes all the necessary care, including about my clothes, travel items, medicines and diet. 






He has even scolded officials if I somehow miss my lunch or medicines,"" the 82-year-old NCP leader said. Describing how he got the driver, Pawar said Gama was earlier the driver of Dr M R Shah from Baramati (in Pune district). ""When my then party gave me a vehicle for party works, I had no driver for it. One day, I casually mentioned to Dr Shah about my requirement and he immediately asked Gama to start working for me. Since then, he has been relentlessly working for me,” he said. 
Pawar said Gama takes care of the vehicles in which he travels. “If the vehicle has some issues, he upfront refuses to use it for driving and I have always listened to him,” he said. Pawar said as he has been travelling across the state for so many years, Gama knows the locations and houses of various personalities and takes him there without any hassle. 






Springing a surprise, Pawar on Tuesday said at the book event that he is stepping down as chief of the NCP, the political outfit he founded and helmed since 1999.

","Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has in his book fondly mentioned his driver 'Gama', who has been taking him to various parts of Maharashtra for the last 43 years. Pawar lauded Gama for never causing any accident and never speaking about the leader's interactions with prominent personalities and politicians while travelling in his vehicle."
19,World saw what I did: Uddhav on Pawar's 'political acumen' remark,2023-05-04,04:54 pm,Bhuvnesh Ojha,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawars-decision-wont-dent-maha-vikas-aghadi-am-not-against-pm-uddhav-101683190197190-amp.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/4_thu/img_1683197707977_580.jpg,"
In his first reaction to Sharad Pawar's announcement of resigning from the president post of the Nationalist Congress Party, former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said the developments in the NCP won't affect the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance. Uddhav whom Sharad Pawar criticised in his recently released autobiography for weak leadership commented on the NCP tumult interacting with the media in Mumbai. Talking about the united opposition, Uddhav said nothing can stop the coming together of forces against dictatorship. ""Opposition should go beyond the word opposition and become a force against dictatorsship. I am not against PM Modi; I am against dictatorship,"" Uddhav said.

Though both the Congress and the Uddhav Sena have asserted that Sharad Pawar's decision to quit the president post won't affect the alliance in Maharashtra hoping that NCP will remain with the alliance which formed the government in 2019 and remained in power till 2022, the politics in Maharashtra is in crosshairs as the future of the NCP remains uncertain.




'World saw what I did as CM'






Replying to Sharad Pawar's statement in his autobiography that Uddhav was weak and could not quell the rumblings inside his party and resigned without giving a fight, Uddhav said, “ The world saw what I did as the chief minister.""‘Khud ka bal dikhao, why taking name of Bajrangbali’
Slamming both the Congress and the BJP for making 'Bajrang' an issue in poll-bound Karnataka, Uddhav said, ""I will urge Marathi-speaking people in Karnataka to say 'Jai Bhavani, 'Jai Shivaji'. Balasaheb's voting rights were taken away for seeking votes on Hindutva. I don't know how this could be done in a democracy. And now PM Modi is asking voters to say Jai Bajrangbali. There must have been some changes in the politics then.

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday blasted the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in a veiled tweet after protesting wrestlers alleged that the Delhi Police manhandled and abused them during a scuffle late last night at Jantar Mantar. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo backed the aggrieved wrestlers and said “disrobing the honour of our daughters in this manner is utterly shameful.” 




West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on wrestlers protest.








“India stands by its daughters and I as a human being definitely stand by our wrestlers. Law is one for all. “Law of the ruler” cant hijack the dignity of these fighters. You can assault them but can’t break their spirit. The fight is right and the fight will continue,” the chief minister said.
“Don’t dare to hurt our wrestlers, the nation is watching their tears and the nation won’t forgive you. I urge our wrestlers to stay strong, I share all my strength with them,” she added.
Banerjee's tweet came after a video of visibly distraught women wrestlers was widely shared on social media as they broke into tears while accusing the police of misbehaviour. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also slammed the BJP over the scuffle at Jantar Mantar between wrestlers and police and called its treatment of national sportspersons shameful and arrogant. 






Kejriwal said that arrogance has gone to the head of the BJP and it wanted to run the system through ""hooliganism"" as he called on people to throw it out of power. Sharing a video of Jantar Mantar, he tweeted ""such behaviour with the champion players of the country? This is extremely unfortunate and shameful...""
""I appeal to all the people in the country...no more...do not tolerate BJP's hooliganism, the time has come to uproot the BJP and chase them away,"" he wrote.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the manhandling of female wrestlers. ""Such behaviour with the players of the country is shameful,"" he said.
""'Beti Bachao' is just hypocrisy. In fact, the BJP has never shied away from committing atrocities on the daughters of the country,"" Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, while sharing a video of the players in which they are seen accusing the police of beating them up.

“Why are encounter killings replacing the due process of law? What blood lust is Hon’ble CM Ajay Bisht instructing UP police to satisfy?”, Moitra questioned in a tweet.




Earlier in the day, gangster Anil Dujana was killed in an encounter with the UP police's STF near Bhola ki Jhaal under the Jaani police station limits in Meerut. According to the police, Dujana fired at the police to escape and was killed during the retaliatory firing. After the encounter, the STF took the gangster to a hospital where doctors declared him ""brought dead"".






The team that surrounded and killed Dujana was led by Brijesh Singh - an Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) with the STF, reported PTI.Also read: Who was Tillu Tajpuriya — Delhi gangster killed in Tihar jail?
According to ASP Singh, two pistols and a few bags were recovered from Dujana's possession which will be sent to the forensic team for examination.
“He was recently released from prison on bail and was trying to build his gang again. A case of extortion was also lodged against him at Dadri Police station of Gautam Buddh Nagar,” Special DG (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar said, reported PTI.
Dujana - the resident of a village in Noida's Gautam Buddh Nagar - had over 60 cases of murder, extortion, and other criminal charges lodged against him. He was arrested last in January 2012 in a 2011 triple murder case. After this, he reportedly began running a gang from jail and operation largely in the NCR region.

AAP chief spokesperson and Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj told a press conference here the party’s Rajya Sabha MPs Raghav Chadha and Sanjay Singh have written to Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora in connection with the matter. The Delhi Police refused to comment on the matter.Addressing the media, Bharadwaj said, “In the last two days, our MPs have written letters on a very serious issue.” He then read out from the similar letters written by the MPs. “I would like to draw your attention to a serious issue. Delhi’s people have made Kejriwal CM thrice. There have been security lapses and he has been attacked. Police are supposed to protect the citizens. But it’s sad that they are not able to keep even the chief minister safe. Few days back, a drone was spotted near his residence but no one was arrested in connection with the incident,” he said.The MPs, he said, have further pointed out that some officers of Delhi Police’s Special Cell have been roaming around Kejriwal’s residence for the whole day.Bhardwaj added, “When asked, they said they are on a special task. What special task is this? Is the Delhi chief minister being spied upon? Under which law is the Delhi Police spying on its own CM? They are keeping an eye on people coming to the CM’s residence.” The MPs also flagged the deteriorating law and order situation in the national capital. “Why is Delhi Police not protecting the CM but spying on him? Is it not illegal? What is the purpose of this? The matter is very serious. We are not objecting to what they are doing. We have objections on what the Centre is asking them to do,” he said. He said the BJP wants to finish the AAP. “Our differences with the PM are known to the world. The PM wants to end the chief minister politically. They want to end AAP and these events raise serious questions. They have to answer these questions — What is the special task given to the plainclothes policemen?” When Bharadwaj was asked whether the presence of policemen was indicative of enhanced security around the CM’s residence following the drone incident, he said the person whose security was being beefed up would have been at least informed.“A senior officer will brief the CM and will ask, ‘What do you want?’ The PM requires more security than the CM. So, is the police also spying outside the PM residence? If the same is being there, we can accept it. No policeman can roam in the area around PM’s residence,” he said.

Highlights: The Congress bagged a clear majority after winning 24 of 34 wards in the Shimla municipal corporation election. BJP failed to retain its power as it won only 9 seats while the CPIM registered victory over a single seat. 59 per cent voter turnout was registered on Tuesday when the hill state went for polling. The elections to SMC were held after a near year-long delay. The five-year term of the civic body ended in June 2022, but the elections could not be held due to court cases challenging the delimitation of wards. The Congress was upbeat about its chances after victory in the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections in December and relied on its performance over the past five months to get over the line. The BJP, on the other hand, counted on the performance of the outgoing Shimla Municipal Corporation board, which it governed from 2017 to 2022.

Meanwhile, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge hit out at the BJP over the tense situation in the northeastern state, echoing boxer Mary Kom's 'Manipur is burning' tweet.
""Manipur is burning. BJP has created fissures among communities and destroyed the peace of a beautiful state,"" Kharge tweeted.

We appeal to people from all sides to exercise restraint and give peace a chance,"" he added.Also read: Army, paramilitary forces deployed in violence-hit Manipur
Violence broke out on Tuesday in Manipur during a 'tribal solidarity march' called by the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM) in the Torbung area of Churachandpur district.
According to other communities, this move in favour of the Meiteis - who account for around 53 per cent of the population - will deny them access to government jobs and admission to educational institutions.






Clashes were reported during the rally in which thousands of agitators took part. In order to control the situation, the police resorted to firing several rounds of tear gas shells and, as the violence flared, chief minister Biren Singh's government imposed a five-day, state-wide ban on mobile internet services.
The Indian Army and paramilitary forces were deployed to save people from violence-hit areas and control the situation and have, so far, evacuated over 7,500 civilians.

Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has slammed Wrestling Federation of India chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh's latest claim that he had only hugged a female wrestler as a father figure, describing it as “sick and disgusting”.




Shiv Sena member of Parliament Priyanka Chaturvedi.(File)








In a news channel interview, a clip of which Chaturvedi retweeted, Singh can be heard saying, “The woman wrestler desired to communicate with her father, but lacking a mobile phone, I offered mine for her to use and connected her with him. After talking, I hugged her. When she felt uncomfortable, I told her that I am hugging her like a father.”
Reacting sharply to his comments, Chaturvedi tweeted, “Sick and disgusting. Taking advantage of the powerful position he is in to exploit a wrestler who came to seek his help. No you don’t give ANY WOMAN A HUG WITHOUT HER CONSENT AND THEN JUSTIFY IT AS A FATHERLY HUG.”










The Rajya Sabha MP hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party of defending the WFI president. “Shame on BJP for continuing to defend this person. Bigger shame that the WCD Minister is still shamelessly silent,” Chaturvedi tweeted.
India's top wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, have been protesting and demanding action against Singh over sexual harassment charges made against him by some female grapplers in Delhi's Jantar Mantar. They are also demanding that the findings of a committee formed to probe their allegations be made public and Singh removed from his post pending investigation.Also Read: Protesting wrestlers slam apathy of ‘politicians’ Usha, Mary
Meanwhile, Vinesh Phogat, the biggest face of the wrestlers' protest, on Tuesday alleged that complaints related to sexual harassment have been hushed up in the past by the WFI and sports minister Anurag Thakur did the same by forming an oversight panel instead of taking concrete action.






Vinesh claimed that twice in the past sexual harassment cases were reported during the national camp but the WFI succeeded in sweeping the matter under the carpet.
The World Championship medallist said the complainants had shared their ordeal in a meeting with the sports minister but he did not do anything except for constituting an oversight panel.
The wrestlers had called off their protest in January after getting assurances from the government that the matter would be probed, and a five-member panel was formed to look into the allegations of sexual harassment against Singh.
Malik said the motive behind the protest, as being projected, was not to seek exemptions from trials. She claimed she was asked to appear in a trial abroad when she had already won a trial in India. Another girl, in 2012, was asked to reappear in a trial within 24 hours of winning.

However, he said that he will not be retiring from active politics. “Even though I am stepping down from the post of President, I am not retiring from public life. I will continue attending public events, and meetings,” Pawar said.






Meanwhile, as the announcement led to emotional NCP workers holding a protest and threatening suicide across the states, Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar said that the NCP chief now would take “two to three days to reconsider his decision.”

There have been reports of legislators planning to leave the party along with Ajit Pawar to join the BJP in Maharashtra. “If he is not the president, it does not mean he is not in the party. He is looking to create new leadership... The new party chief will work under saheb’s leadership”, said Ajit, who is openly supporting the NCP patriarch's decision to step down.

Bharatiya Janata Party's Bihar unit president Samrat Choudhary on Wednesday accused the ruling Janata Dal (United) of an illicit liquor scam worth ₹10,000 crore, even naming chief minister Nitish Kumar.“Today alcohol has reached every home & Nitish Kumar is getting money through home delivery. Nitish Kumar’s party is doing a scam to the amount of ₹10,000 crores in illicit liquor. The administration is collaborating with the liquor mafia and sending all the money to the JD(U) account...That’s why today we take a vow that in 2024 we will win with a full majority in Bihar”, Choudhary was quoted by ANI as saying.




Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.








The Bihar government in 2016 had implemented prohibition policy which bans the manufacture, trade, storage, transportation, sale, and consumption of liquor in the state. However, the dry state has been plagued by deaths of people due to consumption of spurious liquor in the past seven years.










In March this year, a Bihar government data stated that 7,49,000 people were arrested in the state under liquor prohibition law till January 2023, while the conviction rate in cases related to violation is 21.98% till February 2023.
Recently, chief minister Nitish Kumar announced conditional payment of ex-gratia of four lakh rupees each to the next of the kin of those who died due to spurious liquor.
His statement had come on a day when 26 people had died due to the same in Motihari. “We have decided to provide ex gratia of ₹4 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased. But, the amount will only be given if their family members say in writing to the district magistrate concerned that the death took place after consuming illicit liquor. They will have to disclose the source from where the alcohol was procured, too,” Kumar was quoted by PTI as saying.

A day after Uttarakhand cabinet minister Prem Chand Aggarwal was involved in a physical altercation with a man on a busy road in Rishikesh on Tuesday of which a video went viral, an FIR (first information report) was filed by the state police, officials said. 




The minister’s PSO Gaurav however had an altogether different account of the incident. (Screengrab from the video)








The complaint was registered by Surendra Singh Negi, the person who was allegedly assaulted by the minister along with his gunman, PRO and others.
The FIR was registered at the Rishikesh police station under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on Wednesday.

Senior superintendent of police, Dehradun DS Kunwar said, “We have booked finance minister Prem Chand Aggarwal, his PRO Kaushal, gunner Gaurav and three-four unidentified people on a complaint given by Surendra Singh Negi,” he said, adding that they will conduct a fair investigation into the matter. 






In a statement by Dehradun police on Twitter, it said they have filed FIRs under relevant sections on the complaints given by both parties. 
The statement said appropriate and strict action will be taken against the accused. 
“The probe will be impartial, and no culprit will be spared. We request everyone to support us in maintaining law and order”, he said. 
The police registered the FIR on the complaint of Negi after his family members, locals, and Congress workers had protested outside the Rishikesh police station. 
Describing the incident, Negi, who lives in lane number 4, Shivaji Nagar, Rishikesh, said, “I along with a friend Dharamvir Prajapati was on my way from market to AIIMS police chowki around 1:30pm for some work. We got stuck in traffic near Bhardwaj Hospital. I saw minister Aggarwal’s official vehicle standing in close proximity, to the right side of our bike. As I was talking to Dharamvir, the minister lowered the window of the car. The minister rebuked and said, “what are you saying?” to which I replied it was not meant for him. The minister got angry. He came out of the car and hit my knee twice. Then, he hurled abuses at me.” 






“The minister’s gunner and my friend intervened. Suddenly, minister’s PRO Kaushal Bijalwan slapped me. They all joined and beat me. I tried to run to save my life”, he claimed. 
Meanwhile, Negi said the police have also filed a ‘fake FIR’ against him. 
On the minister’s PSO complaint, Negi, and his friend Dharamvir have been booked under sections 392, 332, 353, 504 and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. 
The minister’s PSO Gaurav however had an altogether different account of the incident. 
“Negi and Dharamvir tried to break the window of the minister’s vehicle by hitting it. When the minister came out to talk, Negi started abusing. He then snatched a PAN card, ₹1,150 cash and religious items from the pocket of the minister’s kurta, held by his collar and tore it down. When I tried to stop him, he tore down my uniform as well and started beating us”, he mentioned in his complaint. 






The minister PSO also alleged that Negi threatened the minister and tried to snatch his pistol. 
Negi, however, denied the allegations. 
“Truth can’t be defeated. Everything is clear in the video”, he claimed. 
Jayendra Ramola, Congress leader from Rishikesh said the minister was frustrated by Negi who used to raise people’s issues. 
HT is yet to receive a response from the minister on the same.

When Sharad Pawar announced his resignation from the president post of the Nationalist Congress Party, he was seated with his immediate family -- wife, daughter, nephew Ajit Pawar and hundreds of NCP workers -- as they all assembled to launch the second part of Sharad Pawar's autobiography -- Lok Majhe Sangati. Sharad Pawar's wife Pratibha Pawar was also seen speaking to Ajit Pawar as the supporters objected to Sharad Pawar's decision -- making it a rare public moment for the very private Pratibha Pawar about whom Sharad Pawar wrote in his book.




Pratibha Pawar, known to have maintained a distance from politics, was present when Sharad Pawar announced his resignation from the party chief post.








It was in front of Pratibha Pawar that Ajit Pawar said Supriya will not speak on the issue of Sharad Pawar's resignation when workers wanted her to say something. ""I am his elder brother and that is why I am suggesting her this,"" Ajit said.
Read | Pawar’s decision could be turning point for NCP
Pratibha Pawar played an important role in bringing Ajit Pawar back to the party in 2019 when Ajit Pawar extended support to the BJP and took oath as the deputy chief minister with Devendra Fadnavis being the chief minister.
As Sharad Pawar wrote elaborately on what happened in 2019, he recounted his wife's role in bringing Ajit Pawar back as Pratibha shares a close bond with Ajit. ""Ajit's brother Shriniwas was asked to maintain dialogue with him....My wife Pratibha and Ajit share a strong bond. Pratibha never gets into political developments, but Ajit's case was related to the family,” Pawar said in his book.






After meeting Pratibha Pawar, Ajit apologised and that laid the entire episode to rest. On November 23, 2019, when Sharad Pawar was in talks with the Congress and the Shiv Sena to form Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra, Ajit Pawar clandestinely extended support to the BJP. In his book, Sharad Pawar said he got a call in the morning and was told that NCP MLAs went with Ajit Pawar because they believed Sharad Pawar agreed to the move. ""Immediately, I called Uddhav Thackeray and told him that whatever Ajit did had no go-ahead from me,"" Sharad Pawar wrote.'I told Modi in 2019 there would be no alliance'
In his autobiography, Sharad Pawar wrote that when he met PM Modi in 2019, he told him clearly that there could be no political truck between us (BJP and NCP). ""But while I was saying this, it has to be noted that there was a section of leaders in the party who wanted ties with the BJP,” Pawar wrote referring to Ajit Pawar's rebellion.

41,Say 'Jai Bajrang Bali' while casting vote: PM Modi in Karnataka,2023-05-03,10:24 pm,Saurabh Sinha,https://theprint.in/india/say-jai-bajrangbali-while-casting-vote-pm-says-in-karnataka-cong-calls-it-attempt-to-polarise-election-to-avoid-corruption-issue/1553865/?amp=&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,https://static.inshorts.com/inshorts/images/v1/variants/jpg/m/2023/05_may/3_wed/img_1683128259372_193.jpg," Ankola/Bengaluru/New Delhi, May 3 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday urged the people of Karnataka to say ‘Jai Bajrangbali’ when they cast their vote to “punish” the Congress for its “culture of abuse”, as BJP leaders stepped up attack on the opposition party over its election manifesto promise of banning the Bajrang Dal. Hitting back, the Congress alleged that Prime Minister Modi and his party are refusing to speak about the “scam-ridden” BJP government in Karnataka and are “merely looking for lame-duck excuses to polarise the election”. The party defended its stand against the Bajrang Dal, saying the Constitution prescribes action against any individual and organisation spreading hatred or enmity. Addressing a public meeting in Uttara Kannada district, Modi said the Congress and its leaders hate and abuse him because he has crashed their “corrupt system”. “In this election, Congress is seeking votes in the name of its leader who is retiring…the other way in which they are seeking votes is by abusing Modi… . “Will anyone in Karnataka accept this culture of abuse? What will you (people) do this time? Will you punish them? Will you punish the abusers?… When you press the button in the polling booth, punish them by saying ‘Jai Bajrangbali’,” he added. Prime Minister Modi also urged the audience at all his rallies to raise the chant of ‘Bajranjbali ki Jai’ with him, besides his usual slogans of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘ Vande Mataram’, hailing the motherland. Modi had come down heavily on the Congress on Tuesday after its poll promise of banning Bajrang Dal, saying the Congress in its manifesto “has decided to lock up Lord Hanuman. Initially, they locked up Prabhu Shri Ram (Lord Ram). And now they want to lock up people who say ‘Jai Bajrang Bali’ (Hail Hanuman).” On Wednesday, he made it a point at the beginning as well as at the end of his speech to raise the slogan praising Lord Hanuman in Mulki in Dakshina Kannada district, Ankola in Uttara Kannada and Bailhongal in Belagavi. The BJP, its Karnataka unit and other party leaders also tweeted on Wednesday with the hashtag ‘HanumaBhaktaModi’. The BJP had termed the Congress move as an “insult” to Lord Hanuman and the ‘height of appeasement”. The Bajrang Dal has, meanwhile, announced it will conduct ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ recital programmes across Karnataka on Thursday. “This is the time when ‘Dharma’ is in danger and standing together is the only way forward. We should set aside our differences and come together to protect dharma, and hold hands together,” the right-wing organisation said in a statement. However, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said that the Constitution and law “are clear – any individual or organisation spreading hatred or enmity must be proceeded against in accordance with law”. “The duty to follow Raj darma is of the prime minister and chief minister but they refuse to do so,” he tweeted. He said Lord Hanuman depicts piousness, service and sacrifice. Comparing him “as synonymous to any individual or organisation is an insult, the Congress leader said and asked the prime minister to apologise. “Kannadigas are ready for 40% Bhrastasura Dahana!,” he tweeted. However, Karnataka Energy Minister V Sunil Kumar, who was the state convenor of Bajrang Dal, said the Congress’ move is aimed at appeasing the Muslims. In a series of tweets, the minister said Bajrang Dal is not an anti-social organisation and it strives for the protection of the Hindu community and “gomata” (mother cow). He wondered whether the Congress wants to ban Bajrang Dal just because the BJP banned the Popular Front of India last year. The political row over the issue has spread to other states too. In BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state home minister Narottam Mishra said Congress’ state chief Kamal Nath should clarify his stand on the issue as he is a devotee of Lord Hanuman. “What is its (being a Hanuman devotee) relation with this (banning Bajrang Dal)?” Nath retorted when reporters asked him about the BJP leaders’ remarks. Asked if a similar poll promise will be made by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, he said, “That will be decided by the manifesto committee. Even the Supreme Court and the entire state are saying that those who spread hatred and create controversies should face action. This is a matter of our social unity.” In a letter to Nath on Wednesday, Mishra said, “The Congress may go to any extent for the politics of appeasement.” “I have written a letter to Kamal Nath. I have seen his many tweets in which he posed himself as a Hanuman devotee. Congress equated Bajrang Dal with PFI. Nath should clarify his stance,” he said. He said that this politics of appeasement of Congress has hurt the sentiments of “Rashtra bhakts” and devotees of Ram and Hanuman. Chouhan called Bajrang Dal a “staunch nationalist organisation”. Asking Nath to clarify his stand, he said, “No one will forget those who were pampering the network of SIMI in Madhya Pradesh. Those who opposed the surgical strike and glorified terrorists are now talking about banning Bajrang Dal.” “They are talking of banning Bajrang Dal, which is a staunch nationalist organization, opposes terrorism and ‘love jihad’. The organisation that creates a sense of patriotism, is involved in social service, works for self-respect and awareness towards one’s religion and culture is being compared with a terrorist organisation like PFI?” Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh too posted several tweets targeting Bajrang Dal. “Modi ji’s Religion is Hindutatva’ and not Hindu or Sanatan Dharm. As Savarkar ji has said Hindutva has nothing to do with Hindu Religion’ Bajrang Dal has nothing to do with Lord Hanuman. It is an organisation of goons (sic),” Singh alleged. Rajasthan minister Govind Ram Meghwal said the Congress is not against ‘Bajrangbali’ (Lord Hanuman), but is against the people who are committing a crime by forming an organisation in the deity’s name. Rajasthan Food and Civil Supplies Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that he is an ardent devotee of lord Hanuan. “The Congress itself is a devotee of Bajrangbali. It bans those who try to create a situation of conflict in the name of religion,” Khachariyawas said. Chouhan said that Congress was opposed to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and had called Ram-Setu imaginary. The Congress opposed Hindutva on every occasion and now it stands exposed, he said. Union Minister Anurag Thakur also targeted the Congress. “For vote bank, they used to say that Lord Ram is imaginary… On the other hand, under the Narendra Modi government, Kartarpur Corridor was opened, ropeway reached Hemkunt Sahib…and now a grand Lord Ram temple is being built in Ayodhya. No power in the world has been able to stop Bajrangbali or his followers,” he said. The Congress, in its election manifesto for the May 10 Karnataka polls, on Tuesday said it will take decisive action as per law including imposing a ban on organisations like Bajrang Dal and PFI and alleged that they were promoting enmity among communities. Bajrang Dal is a right-wing Hindu outfit and has often courted controversies over vigilante action. Bajrang is another name for Lord Hanuman and the outfit’s insignia carries the picture of the Hindu deity. PTI KSU GMS MVG ADU MAS RS KSU HDA RT RTThis report is auto-generated from PTI news service.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's son Priyank Kharge has been issued a show cause notice by the Election Commission for his comment on PM Modi in which Priyank called PM Modi 'nalayak'. ""Aisa nalayak beta baitha to kaise hota bhai? Ghar kaise chalega?” (If an inept son is sitting in Delhi, how can you run the family?), he said addressing a rally in poll-bound Karnataka. Citing the model code of conduct, the Election Commission said that it has received a complaint on May 2 against Priyank's public speech where he used abusive language against PM Modi.




The political discourse ahead of the Karnataka Assembly election touched a low with name-calling. (HT_PRINT)








Karnataka Assembly Election 2023: Full coverage
""Whereas the video of the said speech was examined in light of the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and the following part has been found to be violative,"" the notice said, highlighting the 'nalayak' part.
""You are hereby called upon to show cause by 17.00 hrs of 04.05.2023 as to why appropriate action for violation of Model Code of Conduct should not be taken against you. Take notice that in the event of no response from your side within the stipulated time, it will be presumed that you have nothing to say in the matter and the Election Commission will take appropriate action or decision in the matter without making any further reference to you,"" the notice said.






Priyank is a Congress MLA seeking reelection from Chittapur in Kalaburgi district. “When you (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) came to Gulbarga (Kalaburagi) what did you tell the people of Banjara community? “Aap sab log dariye mat. Banjara ka ek beta Dilli mein Baitha hai (You do not be afraid. A son of Banjara is sitting in Delhi.),"" Priyank said before launching the 'nalayak' (inept) jibe. The BJP hit back at Priyank questioning his credential apart from being the son of Mallikarjun Kharge
Priyank's 'nalayak' comment triggered a row at a time when the BJP and the Congress leaders are engaged in an intense war of words, name-calling ahead of the Karnataka election. Mallikarjun Kharge compared PM Modi with a venomous snake and later clarified that he targetted the party and not an individua. A Karnataka BJP MLA then called Sonia Gandhi 'vishkanya' and then Priyank used 'nalayak' to describe PM Modi.

Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Wednesday slammed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for clearing the movie 'The Kerala Story"" which he said spreads 'venom and demonises an entire community'.




Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal.








""The Kerala Story Cleared by the Censor Board Spreads venom and demonises an entire community & The PM in Karnataka says Congress follows “ politics of dividing society "". Sounds unreal !"", the former Union minister tweeted.
Sibal's remark comes in wake of the criticism faced by the Sudipto Sen-directorial ahead of its theatrical release on May 5. The film chronicles the incidents of young women being brainwashed into joining the Islamic State (IS) and heading off to countries like Syria and Afghanistan.
A massive political controversy rages on in Kerala, with the ruling Left, the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Congress opposing the film.
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has hit out at the makers of the film, accusing them of pushing the propaganda of the Sangh Parivar.






""In the movie trailer, we see a hoax that 32,000 women in Kerala were converted and became members of the Islamic State. This bogus story is a product of the Sangh Parivar's lie factory,"" the CM contended in his statement.

While questioning the censor board of clearing the film, Sibal took potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remark accusing Congress of using divisive politics to win votes.
PM Modi during an election rally in the poll-bound Karnataka had urged people to remain distant from both Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) as both parties are “dynastic”, and do politics to “divide people”.






Asking people to be ""alert"" about the Congress and JD(S), Modi said, ""Both are 'parivarwadis' (dynasts), both support corruption and indulge in divisive politics, and Karnataka's development is never their priority.""

Nothing can be decided by media trial,"" he said.The minister said action cannot be taken without investigation in any case of molestation or sexual abuse. “Delhi Police has registered an FIR, investigation will begin and whoever will be found guilty, action will be taken according to law,"" he said.On Tuesday, Vinesh alleged that complaints related to sexual harassment have been hushed up in the past and Thakur did the same by forming an oversight panel instead of taking concrete action. The biggest face of the protest, she claimed that sexual harassment cases were reported twice in the past during the national camp but the Wresting Federation of India (WFI) succeeded in sweeping the matter under the carpet. Vinesh Phogat and other top wrestlers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar, demanding Brij Bhushan Singh’s arrest. She said it was tough to stand against a powerful person who had been misusing his position for long. The World Championships medallist said the wrestlers had shared their ordeal in a meeting with the sports minister but he did not do anything except for constituting an oversight panel.After getting assurances from the government that the matter will be probed, the wrestlers had called off their protest in January. A five-member panel was formed to look into the sexual harassment charges against Brij Bhushan.Excise Policy Scam | ED Informs Delhi Court That Proceeds Of Crime Are Worth More Than Rs 600 CroreParatrooper Siddhant Chettri, Killed in Rajouri Attack, Got Married Only Two Months Back“During the 2012 national camp, a sexual harassment complaint was lodged at a police station. Within 24 hours that case was hushed up. In 2014 a physio, who was also trainer of Geeta Phogat, raised a similar matter and he was removed from the camp within 24 hours. From that day, his wife could not participate in any competition. Before we started our protest, three months back, we had explained everything to a government official how sexual harassment was taking place and how women wrestlers were being tortured mentally. The athletes were being pushed to a stage where they could have done anything with their lives,"" Vinesh was quoted as saying in a report published by news agency PTI.She said the wrestlers waited for three to four months even after women wrestlers had shared individual incidents related to sexual harassment with Thakur. “Sports minister tried to hush up matter yet again by forming a committee. We have tried to raise this issue at every level but the matter was always suppressed,"" Vinesh was quoted as saying, adding that now people can understand why they were silent for 12 years.She also alleged that the Delhi Police was not doing its job properly. “The Delhi Police has not yet recorded any statement. They are helping in breaking the victims, using power and position. Delhi Police is trying to delay the matter. They are giving information to Brij Bhushan. Maybe we will get justice only from the Supreme Court. The kind of language he (WFI chief) is using on national television gives an indication how he can behave with women in a closed room,"" she added.Read all the Latest India News here",Wrestler Vinesh Phogat accused sports minister Anurag Thakur of trying to hush up allegations of sexual harassment. The minister said to let the inquiry be over before jumping the gun in the case against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. He said action will be taken only after a proper investigation.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the entire liquor case is fake which gets proved as AAP MP Sanjay Singh was 'mistakenly named' in the chargesheet. ""Does anyone get named in a chargesheet by mistake? It is clear from this that the whole case is fake. Prime Minister is doing this just to defame the most honest party of the country and to stop the fastest growing party under dirty politics. It does not suit them,"" Kejriwal tweeted after Sanjay Singh claimed that ED wrote him a letter informing him that he was named by mistake.




ED said Sanjay Singh's name appears four times in the chargesheet out of which one reference is wrong.








""This happened in the history for the first time that ED wrote to me and admitted that my name was written by mistake in the chargesheet,"" Sanjay Singh said.


















Sanjay Singh has written to the Union finance secretary seeking sanction to prosecute ED director Sanjay Kumar Mishra and assistant director Jogender Singh for 'knowingly and intentionally' making 'untrue, defamatory and incriminating' statements against Sanjay Singh.
The AAP MP said he already sent a legal notice to the officers to issue an open and public apology.
ED sources, as reported by PTI, said the name of Sanjay Singh appears four times in the chargesheet out of which one reference is wrong and was typed inadvertently. The agency said it has moved a petition in the court to correct the mistake.
On Tuesday, reports claimed Raghav Chadha was named in the chargesheet of the excise policy which Chadha dismissed and said that it was part of propaganda to harm his reputation and credibility. Raghav Chadha was not named as an accused but as an attendee of a meeting. ""News articles and reportage stating that I have been named as an accused in a complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate are factually wrong, incorrect, motivated and appear to be propaganda to harm my reputation and credibility by misleading and using the media. I wish to clarify that I have not been named as an accused or as a suspect, or even as a witness, in any of the complaints filed by the Enforcement Directorate in the ongoing investigation,"" Raghav said issuing a statement.






Kejriwal was the latest to be summoned by the CBI in the liquor probe in which AAP's Manish Sisodia was arrested in February. The AAP government has been accused of taking bribes in exchange for undue favours to some liquor companies in the now-scrapped excise policy.

Hence, I have decided to step down as President of the Nationalist Congress Party,"" Pawar said after the launch of the second edition of his autobiography 'Lok Maze Sangati'.He further said that he would continue working in the political, social and cultural life. ""I have three years tenure remaining in Rajya Sabha. I will not contest elections now,"" the veteran leader said.Ajit Pawar, the nephew of Sharad Pawar supported the latter's decision to step down from the party President post. ""Pawar Sahab himself had said about the necessity of change in the guard a few days ago. we should see his decision in the light of his age and health also. everyone has to take a decision according to time, Pawar Saheb has taken a decision and he won't take it back,"" Ajit Pawar said.Meawhile, Sharad Pawar recommended a committee of senior NCP leaders to decide on the future course of action.

This entire journey of being in public life, which began on May 1, 1960, has continued unabated for the past 63 years, having served Maharashtra and India in various capacities during this period.""I have three years tenure remaining in Rajya Sabha. I will not contest elections henceforth. In these three years, I will concentrate more on issues concerning to state and the country. I will not take any additional responsibilities. I started my political career on May 1, 1960. Yesterday we celebrated May Day. After this prolonged political career, one must think about stopping somewhere. One must not be greedy. I will never take the position of sticking to a post after so many years. Therefore, you might feel uneasy. But I have decided to retire from the post of the NCP chief, "" Pawar further said.The four-time chief minister of Maharashtra has previously served as the Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of P V Narsimha Rao and as Minister of Agriculture in the Cabinet of Manmohan Singh.He was the first and former president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which was founded in 1999, after separating from the Indian National Congress.Speaking after the release of his autobiography, Pawar said that it was time for a new generation to guide the party and the direction it intends to take.The NCP leader, however said that he would not take retirement from public life even after resigning from the party post.""Even though I am stepping down from the post of president, I am not retiring from public life. Constant travel has become an integral part of my life. I will continue attending public events, and meetings. Whether in Pune, Mumbai, Baramati, Delhi or any other part of India, I will be available to all of you as usual.

Ahead of the Supreme Court's final hearing of pleas against the remission to the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case, Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra on Tuesday expressed doubt that the Centre and the Gujarat government may deploy ""delay tactics"".




Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra.(ANI file)








“Our #bilkisbanocase petition listed today at 2 pm for final hearing. Waiting to see what delaying tactics of review/privelege etc will be used by Union & Gujarat state,” Moitra, who is one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court against the release of the 11 rapists of Bilkis Bano, tweeted. She added that “truth shall overcome. Justice will prevail”.
Earlier, Moitra slammed the Gujarat government for claiming privilege over the files of remission or premature release of the convicts in the case of gangrape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of her family members during the 2002 Godhra riots.
“This is a delaying tactic on the part of Centre and Gujarat governments. They were clearly in contempt as they didn't produce the files,” she had said.






During the last hearing on April 18, the Centre and the Gujarat government had told the Supreme Court that they might file a plea seeking a review of its March 27 order asking them to be ready with original files on the grant of remission.
The Supreme Court had questioned the Gujarat government over the remission. The court said the gravity of the offence should have been considered and asked whether there was any application of mind.
Asked about the hearing in the Supreme Court and the top court's observation, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, ""It was not an ordinary crime or just gangrape, her child was killed... Can you imagine what she would have gone through and the the Gujarat government and the central government say these files are privilege.""






""What privilege is there, is it a national security issue? This is a matter of a woman's right. You will have to put forward the truth on what basis you released such hardened criminals and on what basis your people called them 'sanskari',"" she said, slamming the government.
Asking for reasons for the premature release of the convicts, a bench of justices KM Joseph and BV Nagarathna had also questioned the paroles granted to them during their incarceration period.
On March 27, terming Bilkis Bano's gangrape and the murder of her family members as a ""horrendous"" act, the top court had asked the Gujarat government whether uniform standards, as followed in other cases of murder, were applied while granting remission to the 11 convicts in the case.

This development comes the same day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleged that Congress’s history is about “appeasing terror and terrorists”. 
“Can any citizen appease terrorism? Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and Punjab chief minister Beant Singh were among the Congress leaders who sacrificed their lives fighting terrorism,” said Gehlot, addressing media persons in Mangaluru, Karnataka.

Reacting on the comments, senior BJP MLA Vasudev Devnani said Congress has always worked to instill fear… former PM Indira Gandhi jailed whosoever spoke against her during Emergency. It’s the PM Narendra Modi government which is giving freedom to speak. 
“Be it Rahul Gandhi or Ashok Gehlot, they have been soft towards terrorism, they are asking proof from the army about Pulwama attack. The CM first went to Gujarat lauding and publicising his government schemes but faced defeat and the same will happen in Karnataka,” he said. 






Calling the BJP’s manifesto in Karnataka a bunch of lies, Gehlot said they never fulfilled promises. 
“What they have promised till date has never been fulfilled and the public has no trust in them”, he said. 
The CM also claimed that the Congress delivers on its promises. 
“We fulfill our promises and today Rajasthan has become a model state in which every family has health insurance of ₹25 lakh under the Chiranjeevi scheme.”

LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said while missiles manufactured in Lucknow would make the country’s enemies shudder, an upcoming night safari here would make people learn how lions live.

“From the Brahmos missiles to night safari where the lion would be moving in the open and the humans would move in protection, Lucknow is set to witness development and some exciting times. That is why it is important to cast your vote wisely and choose a party that has brought focus on development,” said Adityanath addressing a public meeting in the state capital. 
“It is important that you realise that this is not the time to get trapped in caste and communal considerations. You must vote for a BJP majority municipal board with the party’s mayor to ensure a triple engine government for even better growth,” he said. 
“Today, all urban centres are turning into smart cities and there is online monitoring of traffic. There is an effort to ensure safety coverage to the entire urban sprawl. With 110 wards, Lucknow is the biggest municipal board and I have come here to tell you that by electing BJP, you would automatically showcase your preference for development,” he said. 






B’khand youth won’t need to migrate: CM
Addressing a public meeting in Jhansi, the CM accused the previous governments of neglecting development of Bundelkhand region and “looting its natural resources”, something that he said none would “dare to do” in his government.
“Our instructions are simple. ‘Kisi gareeb aur shareef ko chhedna nahi hai, par kisi goonda aur apradhi ko seena taan ke chalne bhi nahi dena hai’ (Don’t harass the poor, but won’t let any criminal wander freely in the state).”
“After independence, Bundelkhand was supposed to participate in the development process, but the people in power never gave development any thought. Instead, their henchmen never thought twice before plundering Bundelkhand’s resources. That’s why people of Bundelkhand were forced to migrate and youths became unemployed,” he said. 






“PM Modi laid the foundation stone of a massive plant of Bharat Dynamics in this region and the work of Defence Corridor is also going on. These will ensure employment to thousands of young people. The PM has dedicated the Bundelkhand Expressway, which has become the lifeline of Bundelkhand, and soon the government is going to start its Jhansi link,” he said. 
“We have announced ₹6,000 crore for constituting the Jhansi Bundelkhand Industrial Development Authority (JBIDA). Now, the youth of Bundelkhand will not need to migrate to other cities as they will get employment here itself,” added the CM.

A day after Indian cricketers Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir had a spat on the field at the Ekana Stadium after a match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said that Gambhir's act of “hooliganism” was shameful.




Kohli, Gambhir in ugly exchange over ‘silence’ gesture, aggressive handshake








Taking to Twitter, Shrinate wrote, “Gautam Gambhir - an elected MP and Cricket player who ever wore the jersey of India. But his actions in the recent past and especially his street gang hooliganism after the IPL match yesterday is shameful. I wish…someday such an aggressive attitude would be shown in doing good to the people who have elected them. This is only the hysteria of the upcoming defeat in Karnataka.”










On Monday, during the Indian Premier League (IPL) match between RCB captain Kohli and LSG mentor shooks hands after the match. A furious Gambhir was seen aggressively shaking hands with Kohli before Kyle Mayers walked towards the former RCB skipper to have a chat but Gambhir interrupted and took him away. Gambhir then hurled a mouthful at Kohli, drawing him into a heated exchange. 
From a video footage that has gone viral, it appears that Gambhir was the one trying to charge at Kohli even as LSG players, including captain KL Rahul tried to stop him multiple times. However, Gambhir and Kohli ended up having an ugly spat.
In the end, it was Rahul who calmed Kohli down after having a long chat with him over the Gambhir episode, which was preceded by another row involving Virat, Naveen and Amit Mishra during the match.






The spat between Kohli and Gambhir goes way back to 2013. Since the 2013 IPL, the tensions between the duo have been high. They have occasionally been known to get into heated arguments on field.

As Sharad Pawar's announcement to step down from the post of the president of the Nationalist Congress Party caught Maharashtra politicians by surprise, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) MP Sanjay Raut, who is very close to Pawar, compared Pawar with Balasaheb and said Balasaheb too had resigned from the chief's post ""fed up by dirty politics and allegations."" Read | ‘Time for the new generation': Sharad Pawar as he steps down as NCP chief. Top quotes




Sanjay Raut earlier said Sharad Pawar told him that there was a pressure on some individuals in the party to break ranks.








""History seems to have repeated itself... But owing to the love of Shivsainiks he had to withdraw his decision... Like Balasaheb, Pawar Saheb too is the soul of the State's politics,"" Sanjay Raut tweeted. Read | On Sharad Pawar's resignation, nephew Ajit says veteran leader will…














Sanjay Raut had hinted at a major development in Maharashtra politics a year before the election. But what he hinted at was a clash inside NCP which might lead to a split in the party. Raut earlier claimed that Pawar told him that there was pressure on individuals to break rank.
This led to speculations that Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar might break away from the NCP to support the BJP. While these speculations were laid to rest by the party, Sharad Pawar on Tuesday announced his decision to step down from the post of president. ""There was a signal that the bhakri will be rotated...but the pan was rotated,"" Sanjay Raut commented after Sharad Pawar's announcement, instead of Ajit Pawar's which was expected.Supriya Sule's hint of '2 political blasts'






Though the announcement of Sharad Pawar's resignation comes out of the blue, the development was foreshadowed by NCP MP and Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule. Last month, amid intense speculation of Ajit Pawar supporting the BJP, Supriya Sule indicated that there will be two political blasts soon -- one in Delhi and another in Maharashtra.
Sharad Pawar who founded the Nationalist Congress Party in 1999 -- breaking away from the Congress -- however is not going to retire from politics. He said he will be with his party but not as the party chief. Sharad Pawar's stepping down might make it easier for Ajit Pawar to support the BJP.

South Bengaluru MP, BJP's Tejasvi Surya on Tuesday threw a challenge to the Congress after the Congress promised in its manifesto that if voted to power it will ban organisations like Bajrang Dal, Popular Front of India in Karnataka. ""I am a Bajrangi. I am a Kannadiga and this is the land of Hanuman. I dare the Congress to ban me!"" Tejasvi tweeted as the manifesto created a stir even drawing a reaction from PM Modi. Tejasvi also changed his Twitter profile photo to Lord Hanuman.




 BJYM National President Tejasvi Surya  (File Photo / ANI)








""We believe that law and Constitution are sacrosanct and cannot be violated by individuals and Organisations like Bajrang Dal, PFI or others promoting enmity or hatred, whether among majority or minority communities,"" the Congress manifesto said.














On Tejasvi Surya's challenge, Congress youth leader Manjunatha said whether it's Bajrangi or sangi, anyone who wants to spread hate in Karnataka will be banned. “And when did you become a Kannadiga, Mr Surya?” the Congress leader wrote. 
PM Modi referred to the manifesto and in a rally in Karnataka's Hospet, he said the party is now trying to lock up those who worship Hanuman -- as they had earlier locked up Lord Rama.
Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the Bajrang Dal ban promise is for Muslim appeasement while PFI is already banned. ""The manifesto looks like that of PFI and fundamentalist Muslim organisation,"" Sarma said.
Quoting VHP's Surendra Jain, BJP's Amit Malviya said Sonia Gandhi once opposed the ban on the terrorist organisation SIMI. ""The Congress, it seems, has decided to dig its grave,"" Malviya said.






Founded in 1984, Bajrang Dal is a division of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Karnataka is revered as the land of Lord Hanuman and Hanuman's birthplace is believed to Anjaneya Hill which is near Hampi.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday over the demolition of houses in Tughlaqabad in Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Delhi and said buildings were being razed so the 'land mafia' could take over the area. The ex-Uttar Pradesh chief minister also claimed the homes belonged to migrant workers from his state and neighbouring Bihar.




Akhilesh Yadav(PTI)








Yadav tweeted a news report that said '... houses of thousands of unorganised labourers were demolished... as part of a drive to remove encroachments... migrant workers wept for their destroyed homes...' and that many had resided in Tughlaqabad 'for decades'.
""The houses of people from UP and Bihar, who are residing in Delhi's Tughlaqabad since many years, are being demolished. Isn't there any humanitarian aspect to this? The BJP is conducting the demolition drive in order to grant (the) land to mafias..."" Yadav declared.










Akhilesh Yadav's comment comes after officials from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi - which is ruled by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party - and the Delhi Police supervised the demolition of a number of buildings on the historic Tughlaqabad Fort site.
Archaeological Survey of India officials told Hindustan Times earlier that the Delhi Development Authority had handed over 2,661 bighas around the Fort for maintenance in 1995.
Section 19 of The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, declares no person shall construct any building within the protected area.
The demolition was carried out on orders from the Delhi High Court after the ASI requested an anti-encroachment drive. Sources told news agency PTI 40-50 per cent of encroachments had been cleared and 'more action will be taken later'.






Controversy over the demolitions also reached the Supreme Court, which refused to stop the demolitions but said it would re-examine the issue of rehabilitation of those evicted.
The razing of houses have also led to a battle between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, particularly as the former (which controls the UP government) remains firm on demolition drives statewide to 'bring down illegal constructions'.

Accusations flew thick and fast between under-fire Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and top names in the sport, who held their sit-in protest seeking his arrest over alleged sexual harassment of women wrestlers for the eighth day on Sunday.




Wrestlers Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik at a press conference during their protest at Jantar Mantar(PTI)








Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia declared that getting justice for victims of the alleged sexual harassment will be worth more than even winning a medal at this year’s Asian Games.
Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik who are leading the protests, reiterated their demand for justice while addressing the media at the Jantar Mantar protest site.
The Delhi Police, following Supreme Court’s intervention, filed two FIRs against Singh on Friday, including one under Section 10 of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses) Act as it involved a minor complainant, and another on complaints by six senior wrestlers. The case has been registered under IPC sections 354 (molestation), 354(A) (sexual harassment), 354(D) (stalking) and 34 (common intention).
“We have full faith in the judiciary. This is a battle for justice for India’s daughters. Till the time we get justice, we will continue our struggle,” Punia said. “We will fight till the end, no matter how long it takes.”






With the current protests entering its second week, the training of these top wrestlers to prepare for the Asian Games — it starts in Huangzhou on September 23 — have taken a hit. Malik last competed at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games where she won gold. Vinesh Phogat and Punia followed their CWG gold with a bronze each at last September’s world championships in Belgrade. The trio skipped the nationals in December and the two ranking series in February (Zagreb and Alexandria) that came soon after their January sit-in.
The considerable gap in training and the rise of fresh talent means the seasoned wrestlers have a tough road to Hangzhou ahead of them. The federation, now run by an Indian Olympic Association-appointed ad-hoc committee, is yet to announce dates for the Asian Games trials. The wrestlers have been doing bodyweight exercises and dry training on the road at the protest site.






“We want to play and train for the Asian Games. We train here as and when we get a chance. But getting justice for India’s daughters will be a bigger medal for me than the Asian Games,” Punia said to thundering applause.
Both Phogat and Punia are defending champions at the Asian Games. Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, for the second day running, claimed that the protest was politically motivated.
“I can assure you that 90 percent of Haryana wrestlers support and trust WFI. There is just one family that is protesting. All complainants come from one akhara only which is Mahadev Wresting Academy, and that is run by Deepinder Hooda,” Singh said in Gonda, UP.
Hooda is a Congress Party Rajya Sabha MP, after three terms as Lok Sabha MP.






“You don’t get justice at Jantar Mantar. You have to approach the police and courts. So far, all they did was abuse me. It is only recently that they approached the court. Whatever the court decides will be acceptable to me,” said the BJP MP.
“Akhilesh Yadav (former UP chief minister and Samajwadi Party president) knows me well. He knows the truth,” Singh said when asked about opposition parties visiting the protesters.
Punia accused Singh of politicising their protest.
“He wants to give this struggle a political colour. The day those FIRs were filed against him, he activated his IT Cell to run a defamatory campaign against us. But justice cannot be served on the basis of his tweets. We trust the Supreme Court to deliver justice,” he said.






“Brij Bhushan is claiming that we want to take over the federation. If anyone wants to hold an office in the federation, that individual has to hold an office in a state association. His family is all over various state federations and he is accusing us of trying to make WFI a family affair.”
Responding to Singh’s claims that wrestlers don’t have much support, Phogat said, “You can see the kind of support we have here. Not just Haryana, we have support from various states and across sports. People like Neeraj Chopra and Abhinav Bindra have tweeted in our favour. Nikhat Zareen and Sania Mirza are not from Haryana and have supported us.""
The apex court will hear the matter next on May 5.

""We speak the truth before the people and BJP uses lies to ask for votes. I can give you many examples. For the existing double road, they add additional two lanes and claim it as their project.

Karnataka Congress on Sunday launched the ‘CryPM campaign’, akin to its ‘PayCM’ campaign in the poll-bound state. The move comes after Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks about verbal abuse against him. 




Congress workers on social media widely shared an image of PM Modi’s face on a QR Code (Twitter/@IYCKarnataka)








Congress workers on social media widely shared an image of PM Modi’s face on a QR Code. They also shared a video of Priyanka Gandhi criticising Modi saying, “This is the first PM we have seen who cries before people saying he is being abused.”
“It is @narendramodi who asks for votes by telling his problems without listening to people’s pain. Have you forgotten that the job of a Prime Minister is to talk about and solve people’s problems? Our leaders Siddaramaiah and Parameshwar were physically attacked by you guys. We never made it an issue! #CryPMPayCM”, Karnataka Congress tweeted.

Addressing a poll rally in Bagalkote on Sunday, Priyanka jibed at PM Modi during her speech at Karnataka’s Jamkhandi rally saying, “I have never before seen a prime minister who does not care about your troubles but comes crying to you instead. His office has made a list. It’s not the list of your problems, but of the alleged abuses that PM insists have been hurled at him.”






She said that the prime minister should show some strength instead of just crying. “Take a lesson in courage from my brother (Rahul Gandhi) who is ready to take a bullet for the country” she had said. 
“It is strange what I’m seeing for the past two-three days. I have seen many Prime Ministers, Indira Ji (Indira Gandhi), who took bullets for this country. I have seen Rajiv Gandhi, who sacrificed his life for this country. I have seen P V Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh working hard for this country,” she said.
Meanwhile, speaking to the news agency ANI, Bommai said, “The PM has never cried. It is the Congress who has been crying for the past nine years. People also don’t have sympathy for them.”






As the battle for Karnataka reaches a fervent pitch, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress are engaged in an intense war of words in which PM Modi and Sonia Gandhi have been dragged.

Earlier, targeting the Congress over its party president Mallikarjun Kharge’s “venomous snake” barb at him, Modi on Saturday said till now, the party and its leaders hurled abuses at him on 91 occasions.
Meanwhile, referring to Modi’s allegations that Congress abused him “91 times” in different ways and similarly abused people like B R Ambedkar, Kharge said that words are being twisted to consolidate the votes of Scheduled Castes (SCs).






The Karnataka assembly elections will be held in a single phase on May 10, with the counting of votes scheduled on May 13.

Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan made a controversial statement saying ""the revenge of God is very brutal as one can see how not a single piece of Rajiv Gandhi who once had most MPs, was not found"".




Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan.(HT File Photo)








He made this remarks while he was campaigning in support of the party candidate contesting for the presidential post of Rampur municipality.
""I have seen Indira Gandhi's era. Rajiv Gandhi had most MPs in his government but see how not a single piece of his body was found. People like Sanjay Gandhi fly in the sky but are found in pieces. So, once the government is changed, a larger line will be marked,"" he attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party government on Sunday.
Mentioning about the experience of his political life and the entire ecosystem of the administration, he said, ""This is the experience of the political life of 40-42 years. You never know when the roti will turn from the griddle. The authorities and the policemen will change. The policemen who have broken the doors of your house and who have stumbled you, will stand here and salute you with this boot.""






Khan was campaigning for Samajwadi Party candidate Fatima Zabi, who is contesting for the presidential post of Rampur municipality.
The former Rampur MLA had been booked in more than 90 criminal cases after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2017, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
The state Assembly Secretariat, earlier in October, announced Khan's disqualification from the House after a court sentenced him to three years in jail in a hate speech case. The case was registered against Khan in April 2019 for serious levelling allegations against administrative officials posted in Rampur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during an election meeting.
During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Khan was booked for making inflammatory speeches while addressing a public meeting in Khatanagaria village of the Milak Kotwali area.






Earlier, Allahabad High Court in May 2022 had granted interim bail to Azam Khan in a matter which was related to a wrongful possession of Waqf board property land.

Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) leader Sanjay Raut on Monday wrote to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis regarding an alleged standoff between the Mumbai Police and a local BJP leader over a bar being opened beyond the stipulated time limit. Narrating the incident, Raut said that Sachin Kamble of the Sambhaji Brigade pleaded with the staff to control the situation inside the bar that allegedly remained open around 3.30am, leading to a scuffle with the patrons, including one BJP leader Mohit Kamboj.




Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) leader Sanjay Raut and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis (Right).








Kamble called the police for assistance but Mohit Kamboj threatened them and repeatedly mentioned the names of Fadnavis and Union home minister Amit Shah, placing undue pressure on the policemen, Raut alleged.
According to Raut, Kamboj told the policemen, “If you dare, show me out of here. I'll call Devendra now.”
The Shiv Sena (UBT) leader also alleged that Kamboj was in a drunken state and continued to consume liquor even in front of the police.
“Illegal consumption and sale of drugs were going on till Saturday morning and a BJP leader was present there in a drunken state and was threatening the police in the name of the Home Minister. This matter is serious. Investigate who owns the 'Radio' bar of Khar West, file a case against the BJP leader who threatened the police and take immediate action and cancel the license of the concerned 'Radio' bar which violated the rules,"" Raut said in a letter to Devendra Fadnavis who handles the home portfolio.






Posting the letter on Twitter, Sanjay Raut mentioned the Sunday incident when singer AR Rahman's live concert was stopped for exceeding the time limit and asked if the law is equal for everyone. On Sunday, the cops walked onto the stage and asked AR Rahman to stop the performance, a video of which has gone viral on the internet. Following the incident, Pune Police issued a clarification and said the singer-music composer had exceeded the 10pm deadline.
""Pune Police stop Oscar award winner #ARRahmanconcert midway for exceeding time limit. But, on the other hand one Mumbai BJP leader dances in Mumbai Bar till 3.30 am,"" Raut said in a tweet.
“Mr @Dev_Fadnavis Isn't the law equal for everyone? Or are your leaders bigger than the land of the law?”

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh reportedly said he will resign if the top party leaders ask him to, saying “justice is waiting for your 'yes'.” Facing allegations of sexual harassment from some of India's top wrestlers, WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh reportedly said that he will step down from the post if any of the top leaders will ask him to quit.




Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.(ANI)








“If the PM asks, I will resign immediately. Even if (Union home minister) Amit Shah and (BJP President) JP Nadda ask, I will do so,” Singh was quoted as saying by News24.
Reacting to his statement, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who met and extended her support to the protesting wrestlers at Delhi's Jantar Mantar, said in a tweet, “@narendramodi ji keh dijiye. Nyay ko aapki ‘haan’ ka intezaar hai (@narendramodi ji ask him. Justice awaits your 'yes').""










Two FIRs have been filed against the BJP MP following the Supreme Court's intervention, the first pertaining to allegations levelled by a minor, which has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) concerning outraging modesty.
The protests against the WFI chief first broke out in January but the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the government then managed to placate the situation by forming a probe panel. Top Indian wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, among others renewed their protest last week demanding action against the BJP leader.
On Monday, Singh said that all activity in the sport had come to a standstill in the last four months due to protests by the country's top wrestlers. The WFI chief added that he is ready to be ""hanged"" but wrestling activity, including national championships and camps, should not stop as it would be detrimental to the cadet and junior wrestlers.






""All wrestling activity has come to a standstill in the the last four months. I say hang me, but don't stop wrestling activity; don't play with the future of children. Allow the cadet nationals to take place, whosoever organises it... be it Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, but don't stop the (wrestling) activity,"" said Brij Bhushan in an interaction with the media.

Days after Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's ""venomous snake"" barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his son and former minister Priyank Kharge has now triggered another controversy by calling the top BJP leader ‘nalayak’. Priyank, who is seeking reelection from Chittapur in Kalaburagi district in the upcoming Karnataka assembly polls, said the prime minister, while claiming to be the son of the Banjara community, was “inept” in taking care of them because his party created confusion about reservations for the Scheduled Caste (SC) community.

“When you (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) came to Gulbarga (Kalaburagi) what did you tell the people of Banjara community? “Aap sab log dariye mat. Banjara ka ek beta Dilli mein Baitha hai (You do not be afraid. A son of Banjara is sitting in Delhi.),"" said Priyank, quoting from Modi's speech.
""Aisa nalayak beta baitha to kaise hota bhai? Ghar kaise chalega?” (If an inept son is sitting in Delhi, how can you run the family?), he asked, addressing the people.
He went on to say, ""What we are saying is that he said he is the son of the Banjara community and created confusion pertaining to the reservation. Didn’t injustice happen to the Banjara community? Why were stones thrown at Yediyurappa’s house in Shikaripura (in Shivamogga district)? Why Bandh was observed in Kalaburagi and Jewargi? Today there is confusion in the reservation.""






Priyank also took a swipe at the prime minister for calling himself the son of the Koli, Kabbaliga and Kuruba communities during his earlier visit and now calling himself a son of the Banjara community.
Karnataka BJP has filed a complaint with Election Commission against Priyank Kharge for his jibe at PM Modi, reported ANI.
Sharing a video clip of Priyanka Kharge when he made the remarks against PM Modi, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said the Congress leader should “focus on defending his seat and not punch above his weight.”
“What would Priyank Kharge be doing if he wasn’t Mallikarjun Kharge’s son? It is anybody’s guess! It is quite rich for someone, who is feeding of his father’s name, to call a democratically elected PM ‘nalayak’. It is fine to disagree with the PM, criticise him, but calling him names shows a depraved mind (sic),” Malviya said in a tweet.






Mallikarjun Kharge, meanwhile, defended his son saying he never made those comments for the prime minister. “No. No. It is very wrong. He never said it. Don't put these words into his mouth. He attacked the parliament member who abused him (not Modi). So, don't put these words into his mouth (saying it was meant) for Modi. I am sorry, everywhere this is going on (misquoting) purposely. Morning he (Priyank) condemned it but still you people are asking,"" the Congress president said.

Roy on Monday said that he had written to the district administration last week and sought appropriate action, but he is yet to get a response. 
“I wrote to the deputy commissioner and the arms magistrate on April 28 about the issue after it was brought to my knowledge. The minister has also displayed the arms publicly in the past, but district authorities are yet to respond. I spoke to the chief secretary and the director general of police (DGP) on Sunday. The DGP assured me that he would seek a report from the deputy commissioner and inform about the facts of the case,” said Roy.

According to Roy, Gupta possesses a ‘G44 Model Glock Pistol’ which is on the prohibited list for civilians issued by the Union home ministry. 
“The union home ministry had on January 7, 2023, issued a direction to all states that the firearm manufactured by Counter Measures Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and supplied by arms dealer J. Biswas & Co. Kolkata might be in violation of Arms Act and Rules and if required, the already sold (weapon) may be retrieved and deposited in the state armoury,” Roy said. 
“The district authorities could easily check the records and verify if Gupta holds a license against the said firearm and take necessary action,” added Roy. 
The MLA from Jamshedpur East said any violation of the Arms Act, 1959, could invite punishment of a minimum jail term of seven years. 






Jharkhand health minister Gupta did not respond to phone calls. Moreover, East Singhbhum (Jamshedpur) deputy commissioner Vijay Jadhav said no action has been taken on the complaint from Roy.

“It may be *your* Kerala story. It is not *our* Kerala story,” Shashi Tharoor said in a tweet as he posted a poster of the film that says “uncovering the truth that was kept hidden.”
Kerala Congress has urged the state government not to give screening permission for the film which it said was “full of lies and painted the Muslim community in bad light.” Leader of the Opposition in Kerala legislative assembly V D Satheesan said the film was part of a vicious agenda to sow seeds of hatred and religious animosity but the people will stand united to defeat such forces.
“The film is a bundle of lies. It says 32,000 women were converted and sent to Islamic State-held areas. Its trailer gave enough hints of its content. It is intended to defame the state and community and Sangh Parivar outfits are behind this,” said V D Satheesan.






“The Kerala Story”, starring Adah Sharma, is set to hit the screen on May 5. The film, written and directed by Sudipto Sen, is portrayed as ""unearthing"" the events behind ""approximately 32,000 women"" allegedly going missing in Kerala.
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday hit out at the makers of the “The Kerala Story”, alleging that they were pushing the propaganda of Sangh Parivar – an umbrella term used to refer to a family of organizations that are affiliated with or inspired by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the Bharatiya Janta Party – of projecting the southern state as a centre of religious extremism.
